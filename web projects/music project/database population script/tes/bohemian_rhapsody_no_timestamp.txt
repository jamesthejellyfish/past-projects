Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
Im just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because Im easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesnt really matter to me
To me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now hes dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now Ive gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didnt mean to make you cry
If Im not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters
gentle piano solo
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Bodys aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, Ive got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
As the wind blows
I dont want to die
I sometimes wish Id never been born at all
electric guitar solo
rhythmic piano solo
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo Figaro
Magnifico o o o o
Im just a poor boy, nobody loves me
Hes just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah
No, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Never let you go, never, never, never, never let me go
Oh oh oh oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me, for me
energetic guitar music
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, cant do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
energetic rock music
Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
slow rock music
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
slow quiet piano music
slow quiet electric guitar
Any way the wind blows
