<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="5.08">The opening shot is a little confusing
and a little unreal.</text><text start="5.09" dur="3.93">That sense of unreality is because
nearly every shot in this video</text><text start="9.03" dur="2.609">is being played back at the wrong speed.</text><text start="11.639" dur="2.681">We filmed this section at 30 frames a second,</text><text start="14.32" dur="2.57">but it’s being played back at 24,</text><text start="16.89" dur="2.22">80% of normal speed,</text><text start="19.11" dur="1.93">so it just seems a little bit off.</text><text start="21.04" dur="4.55">Plus, we’re using rapid cuts with
no continuity between them.</text><text start="25.59" dur="2.18">Different clothes, different locations,</text><text start="27.77" dur="1">different everything.</text><text start="28.77" dur="3.62">We’ve also got some cutaways
in extreme slow motion,</text><text start="32.39" dur="2.07">because it looks spectacular,</text><text start="34.46" dur="2.84">and it lets me do a moody stare into the distance</text><text start="37.3" dur="3.38">without having to hold it for so long that
it becomes awkward.</text><text start="40.68" dur="3.719">It also lets us fit in some product placement.</text><text start="44.399" dur="2.44">Some of the shots aren’t slow motion, though.</text><text start="46.839" dur="2.641">This is being played back
faster than real time,</text><text start="49.48" dur="3.509">so that the dancers seem more synchronised
and precise than they really are.</text><text start="52.989" dur="2.1">I mean, don’t get me wrong,
they’re good,</text><text start="55.089" dur="3.27">but with the speed change,
their movements look superhuman.</text><text start="58.359" dur="2.16">Also, there are dancers,</text><text start="60.519" dur="2.45">because having attractive people
move in attractive ways</text><text start="62.969" dur="2.231">makes the video more appealing.</text><text start="65.2" dur="2.69">We couldn’t afford a wind machine
for this shot,</text><text start="67.89" dur="2.619">so we bought a leaf blower
from a hardware store.</text><text start="70.509" dur="3.191">We kept the receipt,
so we can return it after we’re done.</text><text start="73.7" dur="2.599">The trouble with filming everything in the
wrong frame rate</text><text start="76.299" dur="2.371">is that my voice won’t sound right.</text><text start="78.67" dur="3.36">So the vocal track for this
was pre-recorded in a studio,</text><text start="82.03" dur="2.54">and I’m lipsyncing it at the wrong speed.</text><text start="84.57" dur="2.009">If my lips don’t quite match up
at some point,</text><text start="86.579" dur="1.441">we’ll just cut to another take,</text><text start="88.02" dur="3.61">or to a completely random slow-mo shot of
an object being destroyed,</text><text start="91.63" dur="2.129">and no-one’ll care.</text><text start="93.759" dur="3.301">Actually, this isn’t the studio where we
recorded the vocal track.</text><text start="97.06" dur="2.769">I recorded this weeks ago
so we could plan everything,</text><text start="99.829" dur="2.121">but we didn’t film that session,</text><text start="101.95" dur="3.99">so we had to go to this separate
recording studio to fake that footage.</text><text start="105.94" dur="2.14">This microphone isn’t even plugged in.</text><text start="108.09" dur="1.81">- We’re now about two thirds
of the way through</text><text start="109.9" dur="2.24">so here’s a middle eight from me,
the featured artist,</text><text start="112.14" dur="2.04">in an attempt to cross-promote us.</text><text start="114.18" dur="3.13">Our schedules didn’t match up,
so this was all filmed separately.</text><text start="117.31" dur="2.081">Despite that, we’re still trying
to convince everyone</text><text start="119.391" dur="2.709">that Tom and I met up and are great friends</text><text start="122.1" dur="1.74">and are definitely in the same room.</text><text start="125.149" dur="2.89">- This is the bit where we break up the video
with a bit of diegetic audio,</text><text start="128.04" dur="2.8">so people can’t just rip the whole thing
off YouTube.</text><text start="136.52" dur="2.04">This isn’t actually a party.</text><text start="138.56" dur="2.12">It may look like we’re having
a spectacular time,</text><text start="140.68" dur="1.639">as that’s the image we want to project,</text><text start="142.32" dur="2.8">but in reality we are on our fifteenth take.</text><text start="145.12" dur="2.14">Everyone would quite like to go home.</text><text start="147.26" dur="2.02">This final section is important, though,</text><text start="149.28" dur="2.429">because it resolves the question at the start:</text><text start="151.709" dur="2.771">why am I falling into a swimming pool?</text><text start="154.48" dur="3.32">Because ending the same way we started
makes the audience think that</text><text start="157.8" dur="3.64">there’s a sensible, circular narrative that
ties everything together.</text><text start="161.44" dur="1.28">Even if there isn’t.</text><text start="164.32" dur="2.62">You can’t buy this on iTunes
or stream it on Spotify.</text><text start="166.959" dur="1.881">It’s... it’s not a song.</text></transcript>
