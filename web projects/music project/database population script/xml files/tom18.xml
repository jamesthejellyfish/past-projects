north.</text><text start="6.5" dur="2.3">Here they provide weather reports not just
for the Arctic,</text><text start="8.8" dur="3.17">but for the transatlantic flights high above
it.</text><text start="11.97" dur="3.38">Because we&amp;#39;re in Nunavut, there are three
official languages here:</text><text start="15.35" dur="3.329">English, French, and the local language: Inuktitut.</text><text start="18.679" dur="3.26">Although it’s difficult to be exact about
languages in the Arctic:</text><text start="21.939" dur="3.221">the line between dialects and languages gets
blurred,</text><text start="25.16" dur="4.269">people in different areas can understand some
of people say.</text><text start="29.429" dur="4.201">Like most languages here, Inuktitut is polysynthetic,</text><text start="33.63" dur="1.96">which means that something that needs a whole
sentence in English</text><text start="35.59" dur="2.25">can just be one long word,</text><text start="37.84" dur="2.19">with each part affecting all the others.</text><text start="40.03" dur="4.74">Now, in Greenland, similar languages are written
using the Latin alphabet,</text><text start="44.77" dur="3.03">but the words can seem unwieldy to English-speakers.</text><text start="47.8" dur="4.58">The Latin alphabet is a writing system that
evolved for a completely different language,</text><text start="52.38" dur="2.04">one with lots of short words and spaces.</text><text start="54.42" dur="1.43">But there is an alternative,</text><text start="55.85" dur="1.72">it&amp;#39;s used all round northern Canada,</text><text start="57.57" dur="2.36">and to my eyes, it’s really cool.</text><text start="59.93" dur="3.69">A bit of history: the reason this writing
system exists is because</text><text start="63.62" dur="4.2">it was invented by Christian missionaries
who were trying to spread the gospel.</text><text start="67.82" dur="3.789">The first books printed in Inuktitut were
extracts from the Bible.</text><text start="71.609" dur="3.521">I’ve put some links in the description to
provide some context there, but:</text><text start="75.13" dur="5.37">there’s no way I can cover that in a short
video that’s mostly about linguistics.</text><text start="80.5" dur="3.2">First up: this is not an alphabet.</text><text start="83.7" dur="3.199">In an alphabet, vowels and consonants both
have letters,</text><text start="86.899" dur="1.89">which makes sense when you’ve speaking a
language</text><text start="88.789" dur="3.781">with a lot of complicated combinations of
sounds in it.</text><text start="92.57" dur="2.35">But Inuktitut, like a lot of polysynthetic
languages,</text><text start="94.92" dur="4.159">has a relatively simple syllable structure:
with rare exceptions,</text><text start="99.079" dur="2.29">the maximum you can have in a syllable is</text><text start="101.369" dur="3.871">a consonant, some vowels, and then another
consonant.</text><text start="105.24" dur="2.129">That is it, that is all your options.</text><text start="107.369" dur="4.14">A long, English one-syllable word like “scratched”
wouldn’t work here:</text><text start="111.509" dur="2.63">you need to put vowels in those consonant
clusters.</text><text start="114.139" dur="2.34">You need se-ce-ra-te-ched.</text><text start="116.479" dur="2.881">Long vowels being written with two letters,</text><text start="119.36" dur="2.259">that&amp;#39;s also added to the long words,</text><text start="121.619" dur="2.92">so the Latin alphabet gets a bit overwhelmed.</text><text start="124.539" dur="2.12">But the Inuktitut script is not an alphabet.</text><text start="126.659" dur="1.99">It is an abugida.</text><text start="128.649" dur="3.4">Each symbol represents both a consonant and
a vowel.</text><text start="132.049" dur="3.041">The shape of the symbol tells you the consonant,
and here is the clever part:</text><text start="135.09" dur="2.83">the direction it&amp;#39;s pointing tells you the
vowel.</text><text start="137.92" dur="1.41">And if it’s got a dot above it,</text><text start="139.33" dur="2.32">it’s a long vowel, like aa instead of a.</text><text start="141.65" dur="2.18">I’m not going to get the vowels exactly
right, I’m English.</text><text start="143.83" dur="2.39">And if there’s a little symbol, up afterwards,</text><text start="146.22" dur="2.18">you add another consonant at the end.</text><text start="148.4" dur="1.99">So my name, Tom, would be like this:</text><text start="150.39" dur="1.65">the curve shape means T,</text><text start="152.04" dur="2.259">it&amp;#39;s pointing to the right, which means “u”,</text><text start="154.299" dur="1.491">the closest you can get to an o here,</text><text start="155.79" dur="2.66">and the right angle at the end means a closing
M.</text><text start="158.45" dur="1">Tum.</text><text start="159.45" dur="1.08">If your accent&amp;#39;s different,</text><text start="160.53" dur="1.299">you might transcribe it a little differently,</text><text start="161.829" dur="1.531">you might flip the curve the other way.</text><text start="163.36" dur="1">Tam.</text><text start="164.36" dur="1">And if you&amp;#39;re American,</text><text start="165.36" dur="2.489">you&amp;#39;d add a little dot there for a long vowel.</text><text start="167.849" dur="1.021">Taam.</text><text start="168.87" dur="2.979">So here is a simple word in Inuktitut: anaana.</text><text start="171.849" dur="1">Mother.</text><text start="172.849" dur="1.53">Like almost every language in the world,</text><text start="174.379" dur="2.42">the word for mom is a sound that a baby will
make accidentally.</text><text start="176.799" dur="2.541">Sorry parents, it was probably an accident.</text><text start="179.34" dur="2.27">A triangle means no consonant,</text><text start="181.61" dur="2.739">and pointed left always means a simple “a”.</text><text start="184.349" dur="2.791">Next, that shape means “n”, pointing left
means “a”,</text><text start="187.14" dur="1.28">and the dot means long.</text><text start="188.42" dur="1">“naa”.</text><text start="189.42" dur="1.76">Then the same again, without the dot. “na”.</text><text start="191.18" dur="1">Annana.</text><text start="192.18" dur="2.05">The word for father is ataata.</text><text start="194.23" dur="2.009">Swap those spools out for the curve,</text><text start="196.239" dur="2.261">the T from Tom, and there you go.</text><text start="198.5" dur="1">Ataata.</text><text start="199.5" dur="2.7">And yes, of course it’s more complicated
than this,</text><text start="202.2" dur="2.86">I’m literally speaking baby talk,</text><text start="205.06" dur="1.33">but compare this to the Latin alphabet</text><text start="206.39" dur="4.519">where there&amp;#39;s just arbitrary symbols that
you have to learn.</text><text start="210.909" dur="1.521">There’s design here.</text><text start="212.43" dur="1.49">There&amp;#39;s intent.</text><text start="213.92" dur="4.099">There isn&amp;#39;t complicated letters with unwritten
rules that all influence each other.</text><text start="218.019" dur="1.521">This is an easy script to learn,</text><text start="219.54" dur="4.229">and for an endangered language with only about
30,000 fluent speakers?</text><text start="223.769" dur="2.72">That is a really good attribute to have.</text><text start="226.489" dur="3.921">I&amp;#39;m here thanks to Chris Hadfield&amp;#39;s Generator
Arctic, and so are these two!</text><text start="230.41" dur="2.029">-- I&amp;#39;m Norm from Tested.
