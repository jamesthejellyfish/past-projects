language.</text><text start="3.35" dur="3.6">You may want to watch it first to decide whether
it&amp;#39;s right for you and your children.</text><text start="8.509" dur="3.63">This is the lovely South Yorkshire village
of Penistone.</text><text start="12.139" dur="1.67">&amp;quot;Penistone.&amp;quot;</text><text start="13.809" dur="3.48">Probably once meant &amp;#39;the village near the
hill&amp;#39;, but now it&amp;#39;s...</text><text start="17.289" dur="4.18">well, it&amp;#39;s an unfortunate name.
And they know it.</text><text start="21.469" dur="1.55">Penistone.</text><text start="23.019" dur="1.51">And yes, it causes problems sometimes,</text><text start="24.529" dur="3.701">whenever some programmer decides to just outright
ban certain words</text><text start="28.23" dur="2.389">without thinking where else they might appear.
Suddenly,</text><text start="30.619" dur="1.41">you&amp;#39;re not talking about Penistone,</text><text start="32.029" dur="3.851">you&amp;#39;re talking about &amp;quot;P****tone&amp;quot;.</text><text start="35.88" dur="2.96">And you might think, no programmer&amp;#39;s going
to be that careless,</text><text start="38.85" dur="2.5">but it&amp;#39;s happened a lot. There are many incidents,</text><text start="41.35" dur="1.66">throughout the history of the web,</text><text start="43.01" dur="5.58">about people and towns with all sorts of unusual
names being filtered or rejected.</text><text start="48.59" dur="2.3">It&amp;#39;s generally known as the Scunthorpe problem,</text><text start="50.89" dur="2.649">but I figured it was better to film this in
Penistone because, first,</text><text start="53.539" dur="3.86">the joke is so much less rude, and second,</text><text start="57.399" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s really no reason for anyone ever to
go to Scunthorpe.</text><text start="70.6" dur="3.48">Nope.
Nope, nope, nope, nope nope nope nope nope.</text><text start="74.09" dur="3.25">These days, programmers generally use a more
lenient approach.</text><text start="77.34" dur="4.86">We&amp;#39;ve learned that humans are creative. Endlessly
creative.</text><text start="82.2" dur="5.08">Block words? We&amp;#39;ll add spaces or change one
letter to something that sounds similar.</text><text start="87.28" dur="4.35">Try and filter those, you&amp;#39;ll have a lot of
trouble talking about ducks.</text><text start="91.63" dur="2.61">Try and detect it based on
fancy statistical methods</text><text start="94.24" dur="3.54">and we&amp;#39;ll constantly change
to switch around them.</text><text start="97.78" dur="3.67">As for trying to block pictures or videos...
I mean, good luck.</text><text start="101.45" dur="2.07">If you&amp;#39;d like to get around a web filter,</text><text start="103.52" dur="3.41">just ask any classroom in any school.</text><text start="106.93" dur="2.8">It only takes one person
to know how to evade it,</text><text start="109.73" dur="2.8">and suddenly every one of their friends
does too.</text><text start="112.53" dur="2.53">And all of their friends&amp;#39; friends.</text><text start="115.06" dur="3.05">We&amp;#39;re not just talking about swearing and
adult content here:</text><text start="118.11" dur="3.88">internet users in China regularly use euphemisms
and subtle tricks</text><text start="121.99" dur="2.94">to get around their country&amp;#39;s web and social
media censorship,</text><text start="124.93" dur="3.46">like calling the heavily-censored anniversary
of the Tiananman Square protests</text><text start="128.39" dur="4.21">&amp;quot;Internet Maintenance Day&amp;quot; as everything shut
down around them.</text><text start="132.6" dur="2.1">China&amp;#39;s Great Firewall does work, to some
extent --</text><text start="134.7" dur="3.78">but there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of collateral damage.
It overblocks.</text><text start="138.48" dur="2.51">Other sites and words get swept up and
blocked too,</text><text start="140.99" dur="4.02">and it takes enormous amounts of human support
to make it work.</text><text start="145.01" dur="4.89">If you actually wanted to make an automatic
system that was even close to human levels --</text><text start="149.92" dur="2.06">and let&amp;#39;s not forget,
humans are still fallible --</text><text start="151.98" dur="4.47">that automated system would need to parse
not just language, but context.</text><text start="156.45" dur="2.92">It would have to understand every cultural
reference,</text><text start="159.37" dur="3.16">every innuendo that a human moderator could
possibly notice and block,</text><text start="162.53" dur="3.71">and it would have to make judgments
on whether something&amp;#39;s safe,</text><text start="166.24" dur="3.5">a bit dodgy, or completely over the line.</text><text start="169.74" dur="2.64">It needs at least a basic theory of mind:</text><text start="172.38" dur="5.07">the ability to judge what someone else&amp;#39;s reaction
will be to a word or situation.</text><text start="177.45" dur="3.46">To make an effective internet filter, you
either need a human,</text><text start="180.94" dur="2.75">or a computer that&amp;#39;s basically equivalent
to a human.</text><text start="183.7" dur="1.37">I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s impossible --</text><text start="185.08" dur="1.16">but I think it&amp;#39;s a long way off.</text><text start="186.26" dur="4.84">And if you have something that can understand
people that well, that can empathise,</text><text start="191.12" dur="2.67">that can predict reactions and behaviour,</text><text start="193.8" dur="3.449">you&amp;#39;ve got something a lot more
than a web filter.</text><text start="197.26" dur="2.612">You might even have something that,
by some standards --</text><text start="199.88" dur="3.28">like the old Turing Test -- counts as a person.</text><text start="205.04" dur="3.1">[Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]</text></transcript>
