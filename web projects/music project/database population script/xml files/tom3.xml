to find on a supermarket shelf.</text><text start="3.69" dur="2.269">But “vegan tomatoes” wouldn’t be.</text><text start="5.959" dur="2.401">In fact, those tomatoes
would sound a bit suspicious:</text><text start="8.39" dur="3.49">it’s the same as the old joke
about asbestos-free cereal.</text><text start="11.88" dur="3.05">Those labels are ignoring one
of Grice’s Maxims,</text><text start="14.93" dur="3.95">a set of… guidelines that explain how we
communicate with each other.</text><text start="18.88" dur="1.86">Paul Grice was a philosopher of language,</text><text start="20.74" dur="3.31">and in &amp;#39;75 he published a paper called
&amp;quot;Logic and Conversation&amp;quot;.</text><text start="24.05" dur="5.449">He was dealing with the gap between natural
language and what’s called “logical formalism”.</text><text start="29.499" dur="4.761">Basically, we communicate far more than just
the literal meaning of our words.</text><text start="34.26" dur="5.58">Grice wrote that for that to be possible without
having some hyper-logical unambiguous language,</text><text start="39.84" dur="2.48">we must be operating under some shared assumptions,</text><text start="42.32" dur="2.78">what he called the Cooperative Principle.</text><text start="45.1" dur="4.22">We assume that we are cooperating
with each other when we are talking.</text><text start="49.32" dur="1.62">Which is obvious, right?</text><text start="50.94" dur="1.48">But there&amp;#39;s a deeper point there:</text><text start="52.42" dur="2.7">we all try to fit what other people say</text><text start="55.12" dur="3.69">into the context of what’s happening or
what’s already been said.</text><text start="58.81" dur="1">That&amp;#39;s part of why,</text><text start="59.81" dur="3.51">when we play a computer game and
a character says exactly the same thing</text><text start="63.32" dur="3.83">no matter if we’ve just saved their village
or burned down their house,</text><text start="67.15" dur="2.36">we can tell that they&amp;#39;re preprogrammed.</text><text start="69.51" dur="3.07">We can&amp;#39;t find a way to fit their words to
the situation.</text><text start="72.58" dur="3.329">So here are Grice’s Maxims, and if you’re
not in a video game,</text><text start="75.909" dur="3.991">these are the rules that we assume our
conversation partners are following.</text><text start="79.9" dur="1.78">Although, despite how they’re written,</text><text start="81.68" dur="6.12">they are not prescriptive, you-must-do-this rules:
they’re just guidelines.</text><text start="87.82" dur="5.74">So first: the Maxim of Quantity: give as much
information as required, and no more.</text><text start="93.56" dur="1.95">Which is what we&amp;#39;re talking about
with vegan tomatoes.</text><text start="95.51" dur="2.83">We already know they’re vegan from the word
“tomato”,</text><text start="98.34" dur="3">giving too much information is strange.</text><text start="101.34" dur="4.069">Next, the Maxim of Quality: tell the truth.</text><text start="105.409" dur="3.111">Next, there’s the Maxim of Relation: be relevant.</text><text start="108.52" dur="2.46">The person you’re talking to will assume
that what you’re saying</text><text start="110.98" dur="3.16">is related to what they just said
in some way,</text><text start="114.14" dur="2.76">and they’ll try to find
what that connection is.</text><text start="116.9" dur="2.19">And finally, the Maxim of Manner:</text><text start="119.09" dur="2.25">be clear in what you’re saying.</text><text start="121.34" dur="4.08">Although Grice phrased that in a way that
I don’t think actually follows his own guidelines?</text><text start="125.42" dur="4.46">Actually, all of these maxims were stated
and restated at length.</text><text start="129.88" dur="2.55">But then, he was a philosopher.
They tend to do that.</text><text start="132.43" dur="2.61">So let’s have a good example of
using Grice’s Maxims,</text><text start="135.04" dur="2.62">and after that, a deliberately bad one.</text><text start="137.66" dur="2.75">Let’s imagine someone says,
“I’m out of petrol”,</text><text start="140.41" dur="3.77">and in reply, I say,
“there’s a garage down the road”.</text><text start="144.18" dur="4.74">Without context, just using the super-literal,
logical meaning of those sentences,</text><text start="148.92" dur="2.09">there’s no connection there.</text><text start="151.01" dur="1.87">Those are just two factual statements.</text><text start="152.88" dur="3.439">But if you assume I’m trying to follow the
Cooperative Principle,</text><text start="156.319" dur="3.881">then you can automatically work out
a lot more.</text><text start="160.2" dur="4.83">Using the Maxim of Relation,
the garage probably has petrol.</text><text start="165.03" dur="5.07">Using the Maxim of Quantity, we know that
that&amp;#39;s all I need to say in order to imply:</text><text start="170.1" dur="2.52">hey, you can push your car there,
you can buy fuel,</text><text start="172.62" dur="1.97">and you can solve your
whole &amp;quot;being stranded&amp;quot; problem.</text><text start="174.59" dur="1.39">A problem which, by the way,</text><text start="175.98" dur="3.479">was also completely implied using
the Cooperative Principle.</text><text start="179.459" dur="2.851">We can bring the graphics in now, but until
this moment,</text><text start="182.31" dur="6.77">all that backstory about a stranded car was
implied just by the words “I’m out of petrol”.</text><text start="189.09" dur="2.31">Now, using the Maxim of Quality, we can assume
I’m telling the truth</text><text start="191.4" dur="2.55">and this isn&amp;#39;t a lie or a guess.</text><text start="193.95" dur="4.539">And using the Maxim of Manner, even someone
who’s confused by my dialect</text><text start="198.489" dur="3.271">can work out that &amp;quot;garage&amp;quot; probably means
the British slang</text><text start="201.76" dur="2.52">for what Americans would call a “gas station”.</text><text start="204.28" dur="3.83">It’s not just someone’s garage at home
where they park their car.</text><text start="208.11" dur="1.46">That would be weird.</text><text start="209.57" dur="4.74">All that got implied from just the phrase
“there’s a garage down the road”.</text><text start="214.31" dur="2.81">But what about when we don&amp;#39;t follow the Maxims?</text><text start="217.12" dur="5.699">Grice says that in that case, we’re asking
for Conversational Implicature.</text><text start="222.819" dur="4.321">Which is to say, we are implying
something not said.</text><text start="227.14" dur="4.51">There are two ways to break a maxim: you can
“violate” it or you can “flout” it.</text><text start="231.65" dur="1.99">Violating it is just, like, lying.</text><text start="233.64" dur="1.85">It’s breaking a maxim to deceive.</text><text start="235.49" dur="2.43">But “flouting” is
breaking a maxim in a way</text><text start="237.92" dur="3.16">that you expect the other person
to pick up on.</text><text start="241.08" dur="3.17">One of Grice’s examples is a philosophy
professor who has to write</text><text start="244.25" dur="3.95">a grad school letter of recommendation for
a student that they have no faith in.</text><text start="248.2" dur="2.5">And, yes, I absolutely believe</text><text start="250.7" dur="2.95">that this is just Grice quietly grumbling
about one of his students.</text><text start="253.65" dur="3.72">Anyway, the professor writes the letter using
the Cooperative Principle.</text><text start="257.37" dur="3.25">&amp;quot;The student’s command of English is excellent,</text><text start="260.62" dur="3.86">&amp;quot;and his attendance at tutorials
has been  regular.”</text><text start="265.97" dur="2.07">That is, technically, a letter of recommendation,</text><text start="268.05" dur="2.26">but it doesn’t follow the Maxim of Quantity.</text><text start="270.31" dur="1.669">It is far too little information.</text><text start="271.979" dur="3.091">It doesn’t say the student’s
actually good at philosophy.</text><text start="275.07" dur="2.54">It’s flouting the maxim,
and when someone does that,</text><text start="277.61" dur="3.67">they are hoping that the person reading or
listening will understand</text><text start="281.28" dur="2.6">what they’re really trying to communicate.</text><text start="283.88" dur="3.92">And that’s why you see product packaging
that says “vegan tomato”</text><text start="287.8" dur="2.13">or “asbestos-free cereal”,</text><text start="289.93" dur="3.04">or, more realistically,
“low in fat” or “low in sugar”.</text><text start="292.97" dur="4.26">They’re flouting Grice’s maxims to imply
that the other brands aren’t,</text><text start="297.23" dur="2.89">or to imply that those claims
are good things to be.</text><text start="300.12" dur="1.76">And that might not be true.</text><text start="301.88" dur="2.06">But it’s not technically lying.</text><text start="303.94" dur="3.12">It’s just not playing fair
by the Cooperative Principle.</text><text start="307.06" dur="3">Either that, or there really is
some sort of evil,</text><text start="310.06" dur="1.78">animal-byproduct tomato out there.</text><text start="311.84" dur="2.63">Thanks to my co-authors
