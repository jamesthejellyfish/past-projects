<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.07" dur="3.409">Cape Reinga, at the very northern tip
of New Zealand&amp;#39;s North Island,</text><text start="3.48" dur="3.76">is one of the few places in the world where
you can watch two oceans collide.</text><text start="8.4" dur="2.85">So say the guidebooks, anyway.
The truth is a little more complicated.</text><text start="11.25" dur="3">First of all, you can find photos online
like this.</text><text start="14.25" dur="3.529">I took that from a kayak in Svalbard,
up in the Arctic.</text><text start="17.779" dur="3.09">Two very different coloured waters separated
by a bit of foam.</text><text start="20.869" dur="4.251">People online claim that photos like it show
one of the few places in the world</text><text start="25.12" dur="3.77">where two oceans meet but don&amp;#39;t mix,
but no.</text><text start="28.89" dur="4.79">That&amp;#39;s just where a river is washing fresh water
filled with sediment out into the sea.</text><text start="33.68" dur="3.559">The truth of where two oceans meet is just
not that dramatic.</text><text start="37.239" dur="3.501">Here, at least, you can see the waves from
the Tasman Sea coming in from the west</text><text start="40.74" dur="3.76">and clashing with the Pacific Ocean
waves from the east.</text><text start="44.5" dur="1.39">Right?</text><text start="45.89" dur="1.39">No.</text><text start="47.28" dur="3.14">Ocean currents and waves have many causes:</text><text start="50.42" dur="3.58">the weather, water temperature,
water salinity -- how much salt’s in there.</text><text start="54" dur="1.26">And they’re three-dimensional.</text><text start="55.26" dur="5.5">Now, with all the complicated geography and wind
here at the very tip of the country:</text><text start="60.76" dur="2.54">of course it’s chaotic down there,
it&amp;#39;s turbulent,</text><text start="63.3" dur="4.16">of course you have different sets of waves
meeting, but those are local effects.</text><text start="67.46" dur="1.409">As soon as you get away from land,</text><text start="68.869" dur="3.551">the water here will become part of the massive
system that&amp;#39;s defined by</text><text start="72.42" dur="2.42">global weather and ocean currents.</text><text start="74.84" dur="3.09">And those ocean currents are
measured in sverdrup.</text><text start="77.93" dur="4.32">One sverdrup is a million cubic metres of
water, moving at a metre per second,</text><text start="82.25" dur="3.81">and the largest currents measure more than
a hundred sverdrup.</text><text start="86.06" dur="4.18">Those are amounts that make no sense
on any human scale.</text><text start="90.25" dur="5.32">While there are often currents here that might
contribute to that particular weird wave pattern...</text><text start="95.57" dur="5.55">this is just one very, very small bit of the ocean
with waves that look messy on a human scale</text><text start="101.12" dur="1.859">because of the land nearby.</text><text start="102.979" dur="1.971">And despite what the guidebooks say,</text><text start="104.95" dur="4">this isn&amp;#39;t even where the Tasman Sea ends
and the Pacific begins.</text><text start="108.95" dur="1.41">Not according to the maps.</text><text start="110.36" dur="2.48">The official limits of oceans and seas are
defined</text><text start="112.84" dur="2.84">by the International
Hydrographic Organisation,</text><text start="115.68" dur="5.969">and those standards are arbitrary lines designed
to make sure that everyone can agree on what’s where,</text><text start="121.649" dur="6.351">so that weather warnings and marine charts describe
the same areas no matter who&amp;#39;s producing them.</text><text start="128" dur="3.82">Those lines are nothing to do with the position
of any ocean currents.</text><text start="131.82" dur="1.62">And according to those standards,</text><text start="133.44" dur="3.14">the Tasman Sea meets the Pacific
at North Cape,</text><text start="136.58" dur="3.44">a closed nature reserve
about two kilometres that way.</text><text start="140.02" dur="4.56">This is just a windy bit of rock
with a lighthouse and a road.</text><text start="144.58" dur="2.42">That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t come here, though.</text><text start="147" dur="1.53">Cape Reinga is beautiful,</text><text start="148.53" dur="3.85">it’s part of the local mythology,
and it’s worth the trip.</text><text start="152.38" dur="2.26">But when they say it’s where two oceans
collide…</text><text start="155.98" dur="2.12">that just isn’t quite true.</text></transcript>
