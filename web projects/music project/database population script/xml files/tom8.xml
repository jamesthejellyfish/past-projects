I&amp;#39;m losing the light.</text><text start="7.783" dur="2.227">I&amp;#39;ve got to drive on and
then catch a flight soon.</text><text start="10.01" dur="1.45">So I&amp;#39;m going to tell you a story,</text><text start="11.46" dur="2.77">but I have not been able to
work out how much of it is true.</text><text start="14.23" dur="1.79">And that&amp;#39;s okay,
and I&amp;#39;ll tell you why that&amp;#39;s okay,</text><text start="16.02" dur="1.92">but it does put me in a
bit of a difficult position</text><text start="17.94" dur="1.69">because everyone that I&amp;#39;ve met here</text><text start="19.63" dur="2.17">in Wichita Falls, Texas, has been lovely.</text><text start="21.8" dur="3.263">And this is a great story
that sends tourists to their town.</text><text start="25.063" dur="3.457">So, with that said, this is
the Newby-McMahon Building,</text><text start="28.52" dur="2.07">the World&amp;#39;s Littlest Skyscraper.</text><text start="30.59" dur="2.7">It&amp;#39;s not much of a skyscraper,
it&amp;#39;s only four stories tall,</text><text start="33.29" dur="3.76">and its footprint is so small
that it is barely usable as a building.</text><text start="37.05" dur="2.09">Now the legend goes that
back when Wichita Falls</text><text start="39.14" dur="2.15">was an oil boom town, 1918,</text><text start="41.29" dur="1.92">there was a massive construction rush.</text><text start="43.21" dur="2.69">Investors were pouring money
into new downtown buildings,</text><text start="45.9" dur="2.17">confident that the town
would be prime real estate</text><text start="48.07" dur="1.323">for decades to come.</text><text start="50.25" dur="1.51">Unfortunately, it wasn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="51.76" dur="3.06">The boom was followed by a bust
and by the Great Depression.</text><text start="54.82" dur="3.64">But this building caused its investors
more trouble than most.</text><text start="58.46" dur="4.18">It cost $200,000, which is
about $3 million in today&amp;#39;s money</text><text start="62.64" dur="3.9">and the investors thought
that it was going to be 12 times as tall</text><text start="66.54" dur="2.62">because the blueprints
they thought were marked in feet</text><text start="69.16" dur="1.74">were actually in inches.</text><text start="70.9" dur="3.113">No one noticed the little extra mark
next to the numbers on the plans.</text><text start="74.013" dur="5.097">So the new downtown skyscraper turned out
to be only four stories tall and not 48,</text><text start="79.11" dur="2.11">and so narrow it was almost unusable.</text><text start="81.22" dur="2.86">The developer, J.D. McMahon,
ran off with most of the money,</text><text start="84.08" dur="3.18">all that was left over from only
having to construct a tiny building,</text><text start="87.27" dur="2.79">and a local judge ruled that
the blueprints were accurate.</text><text start="90.06" dur="2.93">The investors had got exactly
what they&amp;#39;d signed off on,</text><text start="92.99" dur="1.74">exactly what they paid for.</text><text start="94.73" dur="1.267">The building sat abandoned for a long time</text><text start="95.997" dur="1.943">and it was renovated in
the early 21st century</text><text start="97.94" dur="1.74">and these days, it&amp;#39;s a furniture boutique</text><text start="99.68" dur="1.34">and I talked to the owner.</text><text start="101.02" dur="3.39">- When we first took over this building
with our shop,</text><text start="104.41" dur="4.69">this skyscraper was never
allowed to be entered by the public</text><text start="109.1" dur="1.9">and we wanted to open it up.</text><text start="111" dur="1.89">The engineers had to come</text><text start="112.89" dur="3.89">to make sure the floors could
sustain constant occupancy</text><text start="116.78" dur="3.94">and in fact, they did have to give us
some weight and load limits</text><text start="120.72" dur="2.96">and they did have to put in
an additional structural beam.</text><text start="123.69" dur="2.22">Whenever you have a multi-story building,</text><text start="125.91" dur="4.84">by City code, there must
be an egress and entrance.</text><text start="130.75" dur="5.243">So, they had said, well, we must have
at least two staircases to allow for that.</text><text start="137.04" dur="2.82">Well, if this building
had two sets of stairs,</text><text start="139.86" dur="3.19">it would literally be a building
full of two sets of stairs</text><text start="143.05" dur="3.5">and there would be no
defined space whatsoever.</text><text start="146.55" dur="2.23">So, I think, as the
compromise from our City,</text><text start="148.78" dur="3.49">we do have a state-of-the-art
fire suppression system.</text><text start="152.27" dur="2.68">The fire marshal that comes
to inspect it periodically</text><text start="154.95" dur="2.45">tells me that if we do ever catch on fire,</text><text start="157.4" dur="1.9">we will not have to worry about burning,</text><text start="159.3" dur="2.396">but we might have to worry about drowning.</text><text start="162.95" dur="2.26">In the early &amp;#39;30s, this
was engulfed in flames</text><text start="165.21" dur="2.23">and so the floors were gone,
the roof was gone</text><text start="167.44" dur="2.49">and it got boarded up and
it stood that way for decades.</text><text start="169.93" dur="2.79">We do have some old newspaper accounts</text><text start="172.72" dur="5.76">and some old documentation of
people that were interviewed back then,</text><text start="178.48" dur="4.38">how they wanted the building
to be demolished immediately</text><text start="182.86" dur="2.26">because it was a scandal.</text><text start="185.12" dur="2.45">You know, these people had been ripped off</text><text start="187.57" dur="3.92">and they were embarrassed
about being duped like this.</text><text start="191.49" dur="4.45">However, it wasn&amp;#39;t demolished because
they really needed it for office space</text><text start="195.94" dur="1.2">so it was used.</text><text start="197.15" dur="2.35">So we do have some
documentation like that,</text><text start="199.5" dur="4.42">but the original plans
that allegedly he had given</text><text start="203.92" dur="3.68">to his investors, they don&amp;#39;t exist,
as far as I know.</text><text start="207.6" dur="1.28">- It&amp;#39;s a great story.</text><text start="208.88" dur="2.9">So I started to fact-check it
and I came up blank.</text><text start="211.78" dur="1.13">Here&amp;#39;s what I did before getting here.</text><text start="212.91" dur="3.31">I tracked down every article
I could on every database I could access,</text><text start="216.22" dur="2.66">but they were all too modern
and the chain of references ran out,</text><text start="218.88" dur="1.9">usually somewhere in the &amp;#39;80s.</text><text start="220.78" dur="3.52">There are references to a &amp;quot;Ripley&amp;#39;s
Believe It or Not&amp;quot; panel from the 1920s,</text><text start="224.3" dur="2.46">but I emailed the archivists
at Ripley&amp;#39;s and they said</text><text start="226.76" dur="2.67">their archives are incomplete.
They don&amp;#39;t have a copy of it.</text><text start="229.43" dur="1.43">No one has a copy of it.</text><text start="230.86" dur="1.77">And look, if we&amp;#39;re honest,
&amp;quot;Ripley&amp;#39;s Believe It or Not&amp;quot;</text><text start="232.63" dur="1.99">is not a reliable primary source.</text><text start="234.62" dur="3.02">So, when I got here, I went
to the Wichita Falls Library over there,</text><text start="237.64" dur="1.64">thank you so much to all
the librarians who helped,</text><text start="239.28" dur="2.94">and I looked through the
local newspaper from 1919.</text><text start="242.22" dur="3.78">It&amp;#39;s not been digitised so I had to hunt through microfilm and scan headlines</text><text start="246" dur="1.82">and in the time I had here,</text><text start="247.82" dur="3.33">I couldn&amp;#39;t find a mention of the building
or of the lawsuit at all.</text><text start="251.15" dur="2.4">I did find an article
about the changing skyline.</text><text start="253.55" dur="3.51">It has no mention of a
planned 48-story building.</text><text start="257.06" dur="3.41">So, it feels like the real estate scandal,
the lawsuit after,</text><text start="260.47" dur="2.27">should have been all over the news
when it came out, surely,</text><text start="262.74" dur="2.48">but maybe I missed it.
Maybe it was too small an article.</text><text start="265.22" dur="1.39">In boom times it might have been,</text><text start="266.61" dur="1.56">or maybe I wasn&amp;#39;t looking
at the right dates.</text><text start="268.17" dur="2.44">And look, this is a ridiculous building.</text><text start="270.61" dur="2.73">On camera, it almost looks
sensible but standing here,</text><text start="273.34" dur="2.78">it is very easy to agree
that this building,</text><text start="276.12" dur="2.26">must have been a scam of some sort.</text><text start="278.38" dur="1.66">So, if I was to place a bet,</text><text start="280.04" dur="2.59">I would say that the
scam part is likely,</text><text start="282.63" dur="2.22">that someone came along in
the middle of boom times,</text><text start="284.85" dur="2.16">sold a dodgy building
to gullible investors</text><text start="287.01" dur="4.13">and ran off with the proceeds,
is very, very plausible.</text><text start="291.14" dur="3.4">The inches instead of feet
detail of the story, though,</text><text start="294.54" dur="0.89">I just don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="295.43" dur="1.79">Surely the investors would have noticed</text><text start="297.22" dur="2.42">that their giant skyscraper
only had four floors</text><text start="299.64" dur="0.833">and a couple of windows.</text><text start="300.473" dur="1.657">Surely they&amp;#39;d have questioned the plans,</text><text start="302.13" dur="3.15">so maybe that was a joke from
the townsfolk a century ago</text><text start="305.28" dur="1.04">that got reported as fact.</text><text start="306.32" dur="2.22">Or maybe the investors
were off in another state</text><text start="308.54" dur="1.79">and never got a close
look at the blueprints.</text><text start="310.33" dur="4.66">Or maybe it&amp;#39;s true and they were taken in
by a smooth-talking scammer.</text><text start="314.99" dur="3.69">There is a plausible answer for
every skeptic&amp;#39;s question about this</text><text start="318.68" dur="3.26">and I am not saying
that the story is false,</text><text start="321.95" dur="2.21">just that I can&amp;#39;t find primary sources.</text><text start="324.16" dur="3.22">I can&amp;#39;t find anything from the time
that is evidence for it or against it.</text><text start="327.38" dur="2.29">And if you can, don&amp;#39;t tell me.</text><text start="329.67" dur="1.94">Write an article, post
somewhere authoritative,</text><text start="331.61" dur="2.18">take a picture of the old
newspaper and tweet it out,</text><text start="333.79" dur="1.12">update Wikipedia.</text><text start="334.91" dur="2.61">I&amp;#39;ve reached the end of what I can do.</text><text start="337.52" dur="2.513">But that&amp;#39;s fine,
and here&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="340.033" dur="2.477">Because this is folklore.
This is a trickster story.</text><text start="342.51" dur="1.91">This is the same thing
that appears in mythology</text><text start="344.42" dur="1.39">from across the world and across time.</text><text start="345.81" dur="2.53">If you think you&amp;#39;ve heard
something like this before,</text><text start="348.34" dur="0.833">you have.</text><text start="349.173" dur="1.537">There are a lot of stories like it.</text><text start="350.71" dur="2.31">It&amp;#39;s the monorail episode
of &amp;quot;The Simpsons.&amp;quot;</text><text start="353.02" dur="3.39">All those news outlets and blogs repeating
and emphasizing the tale.</text><text start="356.41" dur="1.8">That&amp;#39;s our modern oral tradition.</text><text start="358.21" dur="2.82">That&amp;#39;s passing on stories,
person to person to person.</text><text start="361.03" dur="3.24">In a world where making up
complete lies to get ad revenue</text><text start="364.27" dur="2.18">is a viable business model,</text><text start="366.45" dur="1.34">this is kind of charming.</text><text start="367.79" dur="2.49">It&amp;#39;s a story. And as long
as those articles say,</text><text start="370.28" dur="3.21">&amp;quot;according to legend&amp;quot;,
or &amp;quot;the tale goes that&amp;quot;,</text><text start="373.49" dur="1.63">then I think that&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="375.12" dur="3.13">We&amp;#39;re human, we see things
as part of a narrative.</text><text start="378.25" dur="4.64">Margaret Atwood wrote:
