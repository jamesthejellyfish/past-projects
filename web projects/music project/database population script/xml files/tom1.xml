gave that one answer.</text><text start="7.67" dur="3.41">But that’s the number according to
the 2020 edition of Ethnologue,</text><text start="11.08" dur="3.809">widely considered to be the closest thing
we have to a directory of languages.</text><text start="14.889" dur="4.361">But here’s the catch: languages are not
separate, distinct things.</text><text start="19.25" dur="2.039">They evolve, split, merge, fall out of use.</text><text start="21.289" dur="4.31">And it&amp;#39;s often difficult to say exactly where
one language ends, and another begins.</text><text start="25.599" dur="2.961">Sure, it&amp;#39;s clear that my English and
another person&amp;#39;s Mandarin</text><text start="28.56" dur="2">are completely different languages,</text><text start="30.56" dur="3.37">but what about my English
and someone else&amp;#39;s Scots?</text><text start="33.93" dur="1.52">Or someone else&amp;#39;s Singlish?</text><text start="35.45" dur="2.3">Or someone else’s rural
Southern American English,</text><text start="37.75" dur="4.13">which might not be understood
by the Dowager of Downton Abbey? </text><text start="41.88" dur="2.1">And it’s not just about location, either.</text><text start="43.98" dur="3.86">There’s a difference between
the English I use here,</text><text start="47.84" dur="3.13">versus what I actually use
when I&amp;#39;m talking to friends.</text><text start="50.97" dur="1.19">And what about over time?</text><text start="52.16" dur="3.56">Where does English start to become
Middle English or Old English?</text><text start="55.72" dur="2.78">At some point, it’s different enough to
get a new label:</text><text start="58.5" dur="3.37">but there isn&amp;#39;t a
naturally-occuring clean line.</text><text start="61.87" dur="5.05">There’s an old saying that a language is
just a dialect with an army and a navy.</text><text start="66.92" dur="2.51">Languages change to adapt to the needs
of their speakers.</text><text start="69.43" dur="2.13">And there are a few reasons for that.</text><text start="71.56" dur="3.47">Maybe it’s to provide new words for new
concepts.</text><text start="75.03" dur="5.84">“Computer” used to be the term for someone
who was paid to sit and do calculations.</text><text start="80.87" dur="2.96">Their job was to compute, they were a computer.</text><text start="83.83" dur="3.36">When automated tools came along,
they took on the name.</text><text start="87.19" dur="2.31">Sometimes languages change to
speed up communication.</text><text start="89.5" dur="4.159">“Going to” wasn’t always a marker for
future tense:</text><text start="93.659" dur="4.061">and saying “I’m going to start” makes
no sense when taken literally.</text><text start="97.72" dur="2.63">You can’t go to “start”,
start is not a place,</text><text start="100.35" dur="2.51">but the phrase “going to” became lexicalized.</text><text start="102.86" dur="2.53">And then it turned into a word: “gonna”,</text><text start="105.39" dur="1.95">and then “I’m gonna” became “Imma”.</text><text start="107.34" dur="6.35">That’s a word in common use that’s probably
under fifty years old. Still English.</text><text start="113.69" dur="3.289">Sometimes a language changes because people
are trying to find an identity.</text><text start="116.979" dur="3.481">The words we use help us
fit in or to stand out.</text><text start="120.46" dur="2">Language changes spread across populations,</text><text start="122.46" dur="3.32">they act as markers of who you are
and who your group is.</text><text start="125.78" dur="5.289">If enough people change their pronunciation, intonation,
their word and grammar choices, all together,</text><text start="131.069" dur="1.621">you end up with a dialect.</text><text start="132.69" dur="3.42">If that happens over and over and over
for centuries, well,</text><text start="136.11" dur="2.28">you might end up with a new language.</text><text start="138.39" dur="3.3">Or you might end up with an old one
falling out of use.</text><text start="141.69" dur="4.3">Centuries of colonialism and globalization
have encouraged the death of local languages.</text><text start="145.99" dur="2.54">And even fairly major ones can be in trouble.</text><text start="148.53" dur="2.44">Icelandic is spoken by more than 300,000 people,</text><text start="150.97" dur="3.599">it’s the national language of
a European country.</text><text start="154.569" dur="2.431">But it’s not supported by
iPhones or Android phones</text><text start="157" dur="2.93">If you speak Icelandic and you
want to use a smartphone,</text><text start="159.93" dur="2.44">so if you want to participate in modern life,</text><text start="162.37" dur="2.66">you need to speak another language,
probably English.</text><text start="165.03" dur="2">Very little media is translated into Icelandic,</text><text start="167.03" dur="1.85">almost no-one who moves to Iceland
speaks it,</text><text start="168.88" dur="2.21">which means that Icelandic youth sometimes</text><text start="171.09" dur="4.32">just use English between each other
as a first language.</text><text start="175.41" dur="2.68">Unless deliberate efforts are made
to keep it alive,</text><text start="178.09" dur="4.229">even a national language like Icelandic
could be at risk eventually.</text><text start="182.319" dur="3.161">So, yes, Ethnologue counts 7,000 languages,</text><text start="185.48" dur="3.24">based on fairly reasonable lines
that they’ve decided on.</text><text start="188.72" dur="3.07">Someone has to draw some lines somewhere,
so they do.</text><text start="191.79" dur="5.95">But of those 7,000, 50% to 90% of them may be
functionally extinct by the end of the century.</text><text start="197.74" dur="2.93">And while I’m sure there would be advantages
to one global language,</text><text start="200.67" dur="1.95">it’s not just about communication:</text><text start="202.62" dur="2.93">it’s about access to culture,
to history, to subtext,</text><text start="205.55" dur="4.73">to the insights that can come from one language
explaining in a single word</text><text start="210.28" dur="2.62">what would take another language fifty.</text><text start="212.9" dur="3.11">If you’re watching this and thinking
“ah, it doesn’t matter too much”,</text><text start="216.01" dur="3.14">imagine how you’d feel if it was English
that was endangered,</text><text start="219.15" dur="3.199">and ask yourself if you’d be okay with the
next generations</text><text start="222.349" dur="4.051">only having translations of the works
you grew up with.</text><text start="226.53" dur="2.14">If you want more linguistics,
then my co-author Gretchen McCulloch</text><text start="228.67" dur="1">has a podcast called Lingthusiasm.</text><text start="229.67" dur="2.22">The link is in the description,
I recommend it.</text></transcript>
