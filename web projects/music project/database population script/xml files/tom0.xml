in Yate, in south-west England.</text><text start="15.6" dur="0.8">Let&amp;#39;s go for a walk.</text><text start="17.6" dur="3.52">This is 400m of never-completed 1970s highway</text><text start="21.12" dur="2">that goes from a roundabout to...</text><text start="23.68" dur="2.4">well, nowhere, it&amp;#39;s cut off by a railway line.</text><text start="26.08" dur="2.24">I&amp;#39;m actually a little bit amazed that 
I only just found out about this,</text><text start="28.32" dur="1.84">because &amp;quot;half-completed road to nowhere&amp;quot;,</text><text start="30.16" dur="2.24">with lane markings and kerbs and everything,</text><text start="32.4" dur="3.6">is very much the sort of thing that I&amp;#39;d expect 
younger me to have filmed five years ago.</text><text start="36" dur="2.56">And this place is not a secret. 
This is a big public common.</text><text start="38.56" dur="1.52">There&amp;#39;s folks walking their dogs here.</text><text start="40.08" dur="2.8">The public can&amp;#39;t drive on this 
road, though: it&amp;#39;s gated off.</text><text start="42.88" dur="2.8">If you look at aerial photos,
you  can see where it was meant to go.</text><text start="45.68" dur="2.96">There&amp;#39;s another roundabout a little way 
over there that it would have connected to,</text><text start="48.64" dur="2.32">completing a small ring road around the town.</text><text start="50.96" dur="4.4">And you can see exactly what the 
plan was... it just never happened.</text><text start="55.36" dur="3.36">And yes, there are a lot of complaints 
about the traffic in this town.</text><text start="58.72" dur="1.44">Also on those aerial photos:</text><text start="60.16" dur="4">some heavy equipment, and a fake bridge
being built just down there.</text><text start="64.16" dur="2.08">See, this road does have a use.</text><text start="66.24" dur="2">The local council makes it available for filming,</text><text start="68.24" dur="3.36">the whole area is closed occasionally 
for television shows to shoot on.</text><text start="71.6" dur="2.32">And they can make it look like 
either a small country road</text><text start="73.92" dur="2.96">or a big highway depending on 
where they point their camera.</text><text start="76.88" dur="2.88">Broadchurch used careful 
angles and one composite shot</text><text start="79.76" dur="1.52">to make it look like a coast road.</text><text start="81.28" dur="2.8">And hospital drama Casualty have 
shot quite a few things here</text><text start="84.08" dur="2.72">over the 36 years they&amp;#39;ve been in production.</text><text start="86.8" dur="2.48">That includes their most expensive scenes ever,</text><text start="89.28" dur="2.8">which involved a huge fake bridge,
crashing vehicles,</text><text start="92.08" dur="1.92">adding a CGI town around the road,</text><text start="94" dur="2.08">and setting off an enormous tanker explosion.</text><text start="96.88" dur="2.48">For all it cost, it&amp;#39;s actually 
a little bit underwhelming?</text><text start="99.36" dur="2.96">Maybe that&amp;#39;s a creative decision, 
maybe it looks more realistic that way.</text><text start="102.32" dur="1.04">And it&amp;#39;s convincing enough.</text><text start="104.08" dur="2.08">This is an accidental film set.</text><text start="106.16" dur="3.36">At some point, some British studio would 
probably have built one of these anyway,</text><text start="109.52" dur="1.44">it just wouldn&amp;#39;t look as good.</text><text start="111.52" dur="2.72">So the question is: why did this happen?</text><text start="115.52" dur="2.72">I don&amp;#39;t actually know. I gave up on 
researching this project half way through.</text><text start="119.92" dur="3.28">Okay, no, I&amp;#39;m just kidding, according 
to one former local councillor,</text><text start="123.2" dur="2.24">it&amp;#39;s because the price of steel suddenly went up,</text><text start="125.44" dur="3.36">the council didn&amp;#39;t want to pay that much
for the railway bridge over there,</text><text start="128.8" dur="1.28">so they put the whole thing on hold,</text><text start="130.64" dur="2.56">and no-one ever started the 
project up again afterwards.</text><text start="133.2" dur="2.96">There are still occasional vague 
political calls to complete it,</text><text start="136.16" dur="2.64">but I would be very surprised 
if there&amp;#39;s any traffic</text><text start="138.8" dur="2.16">other than stunt drivers and dog walkers</text><text start="140.96" dur="14.88">on the Road to Nowhere any time soon.</text></transcript>
