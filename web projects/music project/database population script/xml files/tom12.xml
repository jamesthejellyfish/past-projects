<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.24" dur="3.12">This is one of the most famous 
experiments in linguistics.</text><text start="3.36" dur="1.92">One of these shapes is called “bouba”.</text><text start="5.28" dur="3.04">The other is called 
“kiki”. Which is which?</text><text start="8.96" dur="2.72">This was invented in 1929, 
using slightly different words,</text><text start="11.68" dur="1.92">and it’s been refined over time.</text><text start="13.6" dur="2.72">For most people, the 
pointy shape is &amp;quot;kiki&amp;quot;</text><text start="16.32" dur="2.16">and the rounded shape is &amp;quot;bouba.&amp;quot;</text><text start="18.48" dur="1.68">The majority of studies…</text><text start="20.16" dur="2.88">Wow, that is a lot of citations.</text><text start="23.04" dur="4.4">The majority of studies find that 
pointy shapes are more associated with</text><text start="27.44" dur="4.4">unvoiced plosives and front 
vowels: so “ta, pi, ka”,</text><text start="31.84" dur="2.16">and round shapes are associated with</text><text start="34" dur="4.4">voiced plosives, nasals, and 
back vowels, so, “bou, gǝ, no”.</text><text start="38.4" dur="1.68">Okay, sure, but that’s 
just English, right?</text><text start="40.08" dur="2">We have words like 
‘point’ and ‘balloon’,</text><text start="42.08" dur="2.32">maybe we’re just copying the 
associations from the words  </text><text start="44.4" dur="0.96">we already know.</text><text start="45.36" dur="1.76">One of the founders 
of modern linguistics  </text><text start="47.12" dur="1.84">has an entire theory named after him,</text><text start="48.96" dur="1.68">about there being no 
relation between the  </text><text start="50.64" dur="1.76">form of a word and what it represents.</text><text start="53.36" dur="2.24">But: there’s a study 
where English speakers</text><text start="55.6" dur="2.64">were given pairs of words 
in a language from Peru.</text><text start="58.24" dur="0.8">In each pair,</text><text start="59.04" dur="3.04">one word was for a bird, 
and one was for a fish.</text><text start="62.08" dur="2.32">And the English speakers, 
who didn’t know the language,</text><text start="64.4" dur="2.48">who knew nothing even 
close to the language…</text><text start="67.6" dur="2.64">they could sort those 
words into birds and fish  </text><text start="70.24" dur="1.92">a little bit better than chance.</text><text start="72.16" dur="3.84">Not well, but out of hundreds of people 
answering thousands of questions,</text><text start="76.56" dur="4">they got 58% right. That is a 
statistically significant result.</text><text start="80.56" dur="3.2">And there’s another study where 
Hebrew speakers were given pairs of  </text><text start="83.76" dur="2.72">Chinese characters with 
opposite definitions,</text><text start="86.48" dur="3.52">and asked to match up the 
characters and definitions.</text><text start="90" dur="3.44">Again, slightly better than 
chance, about 55% right.</text><text start="93.44" dur="2.96">And if people who speak 
different languages have even</text><text start="96.4" dur="3.44">a slight ability to figure out 
completely unfamiliar words,</text><text start="100.64" dur="1.44">well, that raises the question,  </text><text start="102.08" dur="2.96">do humans have some sort 
of built-in associations</text><text start="105.04" dur="3.12">between sounds and symbols 
and things in the real world?</text><text start="108.72" dur="4.08">“Bouba” and “kiki” have been tested 
in a lot of languages, and, yeah,</text><text start="112.8" dur="1.6">there seems to be something there,</text><text start="114.4" dur="3.68">what researchers call a type of 
&amp;quot;crossmodal correspondence&amp;quot; or  </text><text start="118.08" dur="1.28">&amp;quot;sound symbolism.&amp;quot;</text><text start="119.36" dur="2.8">Correlations between 
phonemes, the sounds we make,</text><text start="122.16" dur="4.16">and traits like shape, texture, 
brightness, size, or even taste.</text><text start="127.2" dur="3.2">Maybe that’s down to cross-activation 
between brain regions:</text><text start="130.4" dur="3.84">researchers into synaesthesia 
have spent a long time on that.</text><text start="134.24" dur="2.16">Or it could be repeated association.</text><text start="136.4" dur="2.08">An elephant makes a 
deeper sound than a mouse.</text><text start="138.48" dur="3.76">A large dog usually barks lower 
and longer than a small dog.</text><text start="142.24" dur="1.68">If you shout into a big, round cave,</text><text start="143.92" dur="3.44">it’ll reflect back deep, 
round, resonating tones.</text><text start="147.36" dur="2.48">Shout into a tiny cave with 
a lot of sharp angles in it</text><text start="149.84" dur="1.76">and you’ll hear higher, sharper tones.</text><text start="152.16" dur="4.32">Something hard and brittle is more 
likely to make a sharp ‘kh’ sound,</text><text start="156.48" dur="3.04">something like ‘kiki’, when you 
hit it or break it or shatter it;</text><text start="159.52" dur="4.24">something soft and round is more 
likely to make a noise like “bouba”.</text><text start="163.76" dur="3.12">I need to stress this is one 
theory from a couple of papers,</text><text start="166.88" dur="3.6">don’t take this as gospel, it’s 
right to be skeptical about that.</text><text start="170.48" dur="1.76">Plus, it doesn’t always work.</text><text start="172.24" dur="2.16">A paper from 1975 shows the results of a  </text><text start="174.4" dur="2.96">bouba-kiki style test on Songe 
speakers in Papua New Guinea,</text><text start="177.36" dur="3.6">where the results were like they were 
picking at random. No preference.</text><text start="180.96" dur="5.04">And in 2017, another test on Syuba 
speakers in Nepal, again: no preference.</text><text start="186" dur="2.88">The likely reason is that 
the nonsense words they chose  </text><text start="188.88" dur="1.84">could not exist in those languages.</text><text start="190.72" dur="2.64">It’d be like giving English 
speakers a test to choose between  </text><text start="193.36" dur="1.52">“ŋoba” and “tlet”.</text><text start="194.88" dur="3.28">You can’t start a word 
with ŋ or tl in English,</text><text start="198.16" dur="1.52">so the choice doesn’t make sense.</text><text start="200.4" dur="4.32">The frustrating thing is: there 
isn’t much data on the failures.</text><text start="204.72" dur="2.16">Researchers often don’t 
publish their negative results,</text><text start="206.88" dur="3.92">and besides it’s very difficult and 
very expensive to give linguistic tests</text><text start="210.8" dur="4.8">to people who’ve never been exposed 
to any of the major world languages.</text><text start="215.6" dur="2.64">But according to all those studies,</text><text start="218.24" dur="3.52">that bouba/kiki distinction 
is true for most people.</text><text start="221.76" dur="3.36">There may be a link between some 
sounds and some real-world properties.</text><text start="225.12" dur="2.72">And that may be why English 
speakers were able to distinguish</text><text start="227.84" dur="2.48">birds and fish in that 
Peruvian language:</text><text start="230.32" dur="3.76">the birds’ names had more high, 
front, non‐rounded vowels:</text><text start="234.08" dur="2.64">/i/ and /e/, they had 
more “sharp sounds”.</text><text start="237.36" dur="2.48">And while there are 
plenty of exceptions,</text><text start="239.84" dur="4.16">birds have more sharp beaks and 
claws than your average fish does.</text></transcript>
