in the California desert, you will hear music.</text><text start="5.11" dur="2.24">It&amp;#39;s supposed to sound a little bit like this:</text><text start="7.35" dur="6.11">[William Tell Overture, by Rossini]</text><text start="13.46" dur="2.02">but instead, it sounds like this.</text><text start="15.48" dur="15.86">[William Tell Overture, by Rossini,
but badly out of tune]</text><text start="31.34" dur="2.84">That was the musical road
of Lancaster, California.</text><text start="34.18" dur="3.5">And as you may have heard,
it&amp;#39;s a little bit out of tune.</text><text start="37.68" dur="1.84">A lot of money was spent on that road.</text><text start="39.52" dur="4.55">It was a publicity stunt for a car company
who wanted to show off how clever they are.</text><text start="44.07" dur="4.1">And doing the calculations for
something like that isn&amp;#39;t really difficult.</text><text start="48.17" dur="4.29">A musical note is a vibration in the air at
a particular frequency.</text><text start="52.46" dur="4.529">And those vibrations can be made by
a violin string or synthesised by a computer</text><text start="56.989" dur="4.131">or - in this case - made by vehicle tyres
hitting grooves in the road.</text><text start="61.12" dur="4.089">The closer the grooves are,
the faster the vibrations, and the higher the note.</text><text start="65.209" dur="1.37">So take the speed limit,</text><text start="66.579" dur="2.49">divide by the frequency of the note you want,</text><text start="69.069" dur="2.76">and that&amp;#39;s how often there should be a groove
in the road.</text><text start="71.829" dur="3.1">And if people travel at the wrong speed, well,
it shouldn&amp;#39;t really matter.</text><text start="74.929" dur="3.841">It&amp;#39;ll just be like slowing down or speeding up
any other piece of music:</text><text start="78.77" dur="3.79">it&amp;#39;ll be in the wrong key, but it&amp;#39;ll still
sound right to most people&amp;#39;s ears.</text><text start="82.56" dur="2.719">It won&amp;#39;t sound like that mess.</text><text start="85.279" dur="2.7">So what went wrong?</text><text start="87.979" dur="2.5">At this point, I am indebted to David Simmons-Duffin,</text><text start="90.479" dur="2.78">an assistant professor of physics at Caltech,</text><text start="93.259" dur="4.021">whose interests include Quantum Field Theories
and playing baroque violin.</text><text start="97.28" dur="1.859">Because he was, as far as I can tell,</text><text start="99.139" dur="3.79">the very first person to figure out
what went wrong:</text><text start="102.929" dur="3.341">and the problem was probably the English language.</text><text start="106.27" dur="3.529">Whoever did the calculations said that the
grooves should be so far apart.</text><text start="109.799" dur="2.371">Let&amp;#39;s say, four inches for the first note.</text><text start="112.17" dur="3.28">And they meant there should be
a groove every four inches.</text><text start="115.45" dur="2.719">But whoever gave the instructions
to the work crew</text><text start="118.169" dur="2.631">said that the grooves should be
&amp;quot;four inches apart&amp;quot;.</text><text start="120.8" dur="4.38">And that was interpreted as four inches between
the end of one groove</text><text start="125.18" dur="1.899">and the start of the next one.</text><text start="127.079" dur="3.68">They didn&amp;#39;t include
the width of the groove itself.</text><text start="130.759" dur="3.381">But your ears definitely do include it.</text><text start="134.14" dur="3.4">The highest note on that section of
the William Tell Overture</text><text start="137.54" dur="2.21">should be one octave higher than the lowest.</text><text start="139.75" dur="2.03">That means the frequency should be doubled,</text><text start="141.78" dur="2.959">and that the grooves should be
half the distance apart.</text><text start="144.739" dur="4.551">And they are: if you don&amp;#39;t include
the width of the groove itself.</text><text start="149.29" dur="3.619">That error means that every note is distorted
not by a fraction of its value,</text><text start="152.909" dur="1.69">like if you&amp;#39;re travelling at the wrong speed,</text><text start="154.599" dur="3.331">but by a constant amount: by the width of
the grooves.</text><text start="157.93" dur="2.63">The higher the note, the greater the effect
of that distortion.</text><text start="160.56" dur="5.35">And the result is the mess that you are about
to hear for a second time.</text><text start="165.91" dur="1.719">And the really strange part?</text><text start="167.629" dur="3.84">This is the second musical road
built in Lancaster, California.</text><text start="171.469" dur="3.901">The first one, built by the car company, was
too close to residents,</text><text start="175.37" dur="1.77">who complained about the constant noise.</text><text start="177.14" dur="2.28">And probably this note here.</text><text start="180.849" dur="2.751">So the city paved over it and rebuilt it...</text><text start="183.6" dur="3.82">to the exact, same, wrong blueprints.</text><text start="191.06" dur="1.64">That&amp;#39;s a take.</text><text start="192.7" dur="1.18">That is a take.</text><text start="193.89" dur="1">Right there.</text><text start="194.89" dur="4.31">And in order to celebrate that take, I am
going to put my foot down.</text><text start="204.94" dur="1.199">This is an SUV.</text><text start="206.14" dur="2.04">It doesn&amp;#39;t, er... it doesn&amp;#39;t do that.</text></transcript>
