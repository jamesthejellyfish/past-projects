their competition to win</text><text start="4.24" dur="3.12">a tech bundle and dream PC 
setup worth up to £5,000.</text><text start="8" dur="1.04">There&amp;#39;s a link in the description,</text><text start="9.04" dur="1.92">and a question at the end of the video.</text><text start="11.52" dur="2.64">This isn&amp;#39;t the first time that 
this question&amp;#39;s been asked.</text><text start="14.16" dur="1.84">Several web projects have 
tried to answer it before,</text><text start="16" dur="1.84">some are still running, 
and some are defunct.</text><text start="17.84" dur="2.56">And the question itself has 
been used as a punchline,</text><text start="20.4" dur="3.28">asked by an inept, self-obsessed 
radio DJ character.</text><text start="23.68" dur="2.32">&amp;quot;What is... the best thing?&amp;quot;</text><text start="26.96" dur="3.44">Of course there isn&amp;#39;t a meaningful 
answer to that question. Of course.</text><text start="30.4" dur="2.16">But I think there are 
some really interesting  </text><text start="32.56" dur="2.32">challenges in trying to 
find an answer anyway,</text><text start="34.88" dur="3.04">and the results can reveal a 
lot more than you might think.</text><text start="38.72" dur="2.16">The first problem is 
trying to list everything.</text><text start="40.88" dur="1.76">I know it&amp;#39;s an obvious 
thing to say, but:</text><text start="42.64" dur="1.92">there are a lot of 
things in the universe.</text><text start="44.56" dur="2.4">So let&amp;#39;s reduce the scope to  </text><text start="46.96" dur="3.12">&amp;quot;everything that most people 
could form an opinion about&amp;quot;.</text><text start="50.64" dur="2.4">How do you get a list 
of everything like that?</text><text start="53.6" dur="2.56">Well, the starting point is Wikidata.</text><text start="56.16" dur="3.52">Everything that has a Wikipedia 
article also has an entry in Wikidata,</text><text start="59.68" dur="2">but so does every category of things,  </text><text start="61.68" dur="1.92">every property that 
something might have,</text><text start="63.6" dur="3.36">and every link and connection 
between all of those.</text><text start="66.96" dur="2.48">And it&amp;#39;s all designed to 
be processed by computers.</text><text start="69.44" dur="3.12">So I figured I&amp;#39;d start 
by downloading it.</text><text start="72.56" dur="1.96">More than a terabyte of data,</text><text start="74.52" dur="3.08">more than 88 million things
exhaustively described.</text><text start="78.48" dur="2.72">And most of those things 
are not interesting.</text><text start="81.2" dur="2.88">More than that, they&amp;#39;re going to 
be a mystery to almost everyone.</text><text start="84.08" dur="2.64">Every named location in the world
no matter how obscure,</text><text start="86.72" dur="4.08">every species and genus of animal, 
enormous numbers of scholarly articles.</text><text start="90.8" dur="4.56">If you show most of those to people 
and ask them to form an opinion,</text><text start="95.36" dur="2.4">the answer isn&amp;#39;t just 
going to be &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot;:</text><text start="97.76" dur="2.16">it&amp;#39;ll be &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care&amp;quot;.</text><text start="99.92" dur="2.72">So I had to filter 
those 88 million things.</text><text start="102.64" dur="2.56">And the first steps were 
actually kind of easy.</text><text start="105.2" dur="2.24">First, I removed all 
listings for people.</text><text start="107.44" dur="3.84">We&amp;#39;re ranking things, so someone 
else can do &amp;quot;who is the best person&amp;quot;.</text><text start="111.28" dur="0.72">You&amp;#39;re welcome to that.</text><text start="112" dur="3.68">But I just removed any item that 
was tagged with Q5, &amp;quot;human&amp;quot;.</text><text start="115.68" dur="1.84">And that&amp;#39;s good, that&amp;#39;s a good start.</text><text start="117.52" dur="3.12">Also, I removed all listings for 
groups of people, because: yikes.</text><text start="121.2" dur="2.72">Next, places. If you&amp;#39;re doing 
&amp;quot;what is the best thing&amp;quot;,</text><text start="123.92" dur="2.16">no country or river or building
is ever going to win,</text><text start="126.08" dur="3.68">it&amp;#39;ll get voted down by political rivalries
or people elsewhere  who&amp;#39;ve never heard of it,</text><text start="129.76" dur="2.56">so if the item was tagged 
with a latitude and longitude,</text><text start="132.96" dur="1.6">it also got thrown out.</text><text start="134.56" dur="3.12">Also, anything tagged as 
fictional got removed too:</text><text start="137.68" dur="1.36">not works of art themselves,  </text><text start="139.04" dur="2.8">but characters and events 
that aren&amp;#39;t part of reality.</text><text start="142.4" dur="3.04">That still left an 
enormous number of items.</text><text start="145.44" dur="3.2">But we&amp;#39;re only looking for things 
that most people will know about,</text><text start="148.64" dur="1.84">and there&amp;#39;s a really 
good metric for that:</text><text start="150.48" dur="5.44">I kept anything that had a Wikipedia article
in at least fifty different languages.</text><text start="155.92" dur="1.6">I tried different thresholds for that,</text><text start="157.52" dur="2.8">but fifty seemed to have 
the right balance where</text><text start="160.32" dur="3.92">almost everything that remained 
would be recognisable to most people.</text><text start="164.8" dur="6.64">And that brought it down to 8,850 things.
Which is a managable number.</text><text start="172.4" dur="3.12">But there was no way to 
automate the last part.</text><text start="175.52" dur="4.8">I had to manually check through all 
those thousands of things to find  </text><text start="180.32" dur="0.8">the bad ones.</text><text start="181.76" dur="2.32">Not just things that most people 
would vote against because they&amp;#39;re  </text><text start="184.08" dur="1.2">unpleasant or harmful,</text><text start="185.28" dur="4.48">but things that no-one should be asking 
about in a lighthearted web poll.</text><text start="189.76" dur="1.231">Crimes against the person.</text><text start="190.991" dur="3.649">A couple of disturbing things that were 
just listed as &amp;quot;rituals&amp;quot;.</text><text start="194.64" dur="3.28">Anything to do with the Nazis. 
Which it turns out is quite a lot.</text><text start="197.92" dur="3.76">They kept showing up under 
apparently-innocent categories?</text><text start="201.68" dur="3.84">Like, eugenics was just 
tagged as &amp;quot;social philosophy&amp;quot;.</text><text start="205.52" dur="2.48">Mein Kampf, just listed 
as &amp;quot;written work&amp;quot;.</text><text start="208" dur="5.2">Unless you kept constantly vigilant 
for them, they kept trying to sneak in.</text><text start="214.16" dur="1.84">Then there were the dull 
groups of things that could  </text><text start="216" dur="2.16">be summed up in a single entry instead.</text><text start="218.16" dur="3.84">Every time zone. Every language,
every  country&amp;#39;s flag and national anthem.</text><text start="222" dur="2.72">Every individual book 
of every religious text.</text><text start="224.72" dur="5.28">A lot of mythological figures who weren&amp;#39;t
tagged as either &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fictional&amp;quot;.</text><text start="230.64" dur="2.4">Hundreds of generic names of galaxies--</text><text start="233.04" dur="2.88">&amp;quot;Okay, you know what? I talked 
about that for far too long.</text><text start="235.92" dur="2.4">&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s just say I removed the boring 
ones, okay? There were a lot of them.</text><text start="238.32" dur="1.2">&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s skip forward.&amp;quot;</text><text start="239.52" dur="1.84">And then, there was the vandalism.</text><text start="241.36" dur="3.28">All of which has since been corrected, 
but in the snapshot I downloaded,</text><text start="244.64" dur="5.36">someone had replaced the title of 
&amp;quot;graphics&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Pro player de fifa&amp;quot;</text><text start="250" dur="3.92">and the description of 
&amp;quot;worm&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;dog go fishing&amp;quot;.</text><text start="253.92" dur="3.6">Also, &amp;quot;pipe organ&amp;quot; was described as 
&amp;quot;wind instrument that causes cancer&amp;quot;.</text><text start="257.52" dur="4.08">So there&amp;#39;s someone out there who 
really, really doesn&amp;#39;t like pipe organs.</text><text start="262.32" dur="4.4">When all was done: 7,188 things.</text><text start="266.72" dur="1.28">I knew it wasn&amp;#39;t going to be perfect,</text><text start="268" dur="2">people would still find mistakes,
and they did.</text><text start="270.56" dur="4.32">But it was good enough. It was time 
to ask the world which was best.</text><text start="276.56" dur="2.56">One of the best approaches 
for ranking items in a list</text><text start="279.12" dur="1.76">is to show them to people two at a time,</text><text start="280.88" dur="2.8">and then ask them to pick 
the best of each random pair.</text><text start="283.68" dur="2.32">The best ones will be 
consistently voted for,</text><text start="286" dur="1.6">and the worst ones voted against.</text><text start="287.6" dur="2.4">And as long as you have 
enough votes in total,</text><text start="290" dur="2.32">you don&amp;#39;t need to keep track 
of all the different pairings:</text><text start="292.32" dur="3.52">just the total number of wins 
and losses for each item.</text><text start="295.84" dur="1.6">Now, I&amp;#39;ve written code 
to do that before,</text><text start="297.44" dur="2.16">so I just reused it, put 
a quick site together,  </text><text start="299.6" dur="1.36">and launched it out on Twitter.</text><text start="301.92" dur="4.16">My code broke immediately 
because I&amp;#39;d forgotten to change  </text><text start="306.08" dur="1.52">one line before going live,</text><text start="307.6" dur="3.76">I fixed it within a minute or so while 
a hundred people rushed to tweet me</text><text start="311.36" dur="2.8">about something I obviously 
already knew about. Anyway. So.</text><text start="314.16" dur="4.72">Five hours and more than 
1.2 million votes later,</text><text start="318.88" dur="1.68">the order of items had settled down,</text><text start="320.56" dur="3.92">and I closed the poll before anyone 
wrote code to try and break it.</text><text start="324.48" dur="3.2">Now, you&amp;#39;ll remember that each 
pairing was randomly chosen.</text><text start="327.68" dur="4.16">That means some items had more match-ups 
than others, just through sheer luck.</text><text start="331.84" dur="3.36">The outliers were &amp;quot;mold&amp;quot;,
which was in 125 match-ups,</text><text start="335.2" dur="2.32">and &amp;quot;canal&amp;quot;, which was in 236.</text><text start="337.52" dur="3.28">There was the expected 
distribution between those.</text><text start="340.8" dur="3.28">So, at this point, we 
had ranked everything.</text><text start="345.92" dur="1.92">I don&amp;#39;t want to spend too much 
time on the bottom of the list.</text><text start="347.84" dur="3.28">It&amp;#39;s a lot of nasty diseases 
and unpleasant concepts.</text><text start="351.12" dur="1.92">Also one of the Twilight movies.</text><text start="353.04" dur="3.36">I will say that The Worst 
Thing... is Lyme disease.</text><text start="356.4" dur="1.102">I&amp;#39;ve no idea why.</text><text start="357.502" dur="2.898">It did significantly worse than
everything else, by a good margin.</text><text start="360.4" dur="2.24">Maybe, statistically, out 
of the thousands of items,</text><text start="362.64" dur="2">one had to get a lot 
of unlucky matchups?</text><text start="364.64" dur="4.4">But, honestly, it is a really 
long way below any other item.</text><text start="369.04" dur="1.68">&amp;quot;Coronavirus&amp;quot;, also fairly low.</text><text start="370.72" dur="3.2">And anything religious did 
quite poorly, which makes sense:</text><text start="373.92" dur="1.6">if you&amp;#39;re not religious 
you&amp;#39;re rarely going to  </text><text start="375.52" dur="2.72">vote for anything to do with faith,
and if you are religious  </text><text start="378.24" dur="3.76">you&amp;#39;re hardly ever going to vote 
anything other than your own faith.</text><text start="382" dur="2.32">In hindsight, I should have 
done something like consolidate</text><text start="384.32" dur="3.92">all the entries for faiths into 
one just called &amp;quot;religion&amp;quot;.</text><text start="388.24" dur="3.12">Which I&amp;#39;m sure wouldn&amp;#39;t have 
caused me any problems at all.</text><text start="391.36" dur="2.48">Anyway. The best things.</text><text start="393.84" dur="0.88">First, let&amp;#39;s be clear:  </text><text start="394.72" dur="2.8">these are the results as voted by 
the people who follow me on Twitter.</text><text start="397.52" dur="4">This is about &amp;quot;the best thing&amp;quot; 
as decided by, if we&amp;#39;re honest,</text><text start="401.52" dur="3.92">a group of English-speaking, 
extremely-online nerds.</text><text start="405.44" dur="2.48">However, that&amp;#39;s also going to be a lot 
of the people who watch this video,</text><text start="407.92" dur="1.6">so, I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say,  </text><text start="409.52" dur="3.92">as voted by you: here are 
the top ten best things.</text><text start="413.44" dur="1.84">At number 10, privacy.</text><text start="415.28" dur="3.28">And ranked above privacy, 
at number 9, pizza.</text><text start="418.56" dur="4.24">Is pizza better or more important 
than privacy? [indecisive noise]</text><text start="422.8" dur="3.6">...but pizza is more likely to win a 
match-up, and that&amp;#39;s what counts here!</text><text start="426.4" dur="3.12">By the way, the next highest 
food was ice cream, at number 43,</text><text start="429.52" dur="3.6">and while that could imply that
my audience have the palates of five-year-olds,</text><text start="433.12" dur="3.52">I think it&amp;#39;s more that, while those 
may not be everyone&amp;#39;s favourite foods,</text><text start="436.64" dur="3.2">there are very few people 
who actively dislike them,</text><text start="439.84" dur="3.12">so they&amp;#39;ll win a lot of generic 
match-ups just because of that.</text><text start="442.96" dur="3.2">The next items up: knowledge, 
creativity and logic.</text><text start="446.16" dur="4.64">The foundations of human thought.
Given my audience, that makes a lot of sense.</text><text start="450.8" dur="2">At number 5: hugs.</text><text start="452.8" dur="2.56">Which Wikidata clinically describes as  </text><text start="455.36" dur="3.44">&amp;quot;a form of endearment, 
universal in human communities&amp;quot;.</text><text start="459.44" dur="2">Granted, it&amp;#39;s 2020 as 
this video goes out,</text><text start="461.44" dur="2.32">so they&amp;#39;re less universal than 
they perhaps should be right now,</text><text start="463.76" dur="1.52">but that&amp;#39;s still lovely.</text><text start="465.84" dur="4.16">Then we get to three items that I 
honestly wasn&amp;#39;t expecting to be so high.</text><text start="470" dur="2">At number 4: gravity.</text><text start="472.96" dur="2.24">Sure, it&amp;#39;s essential for 
the entire universe to work,</text><text start="475.2" dur="3.2">I just didn&amp;#39;t expect it to beat 
&amp;quot;hugs&amp;quot;. And then, at number 3...</text><text start="479.04" dur="1.52">...the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic field.</text><text start="482.4" dur="2">Like I said, extremely-online nerds.</text><text start="484.4" dur="2.16">Because, again, yes, 
essential for life to exist,</text><text start="486.56" dur="4.72">but just to be clear, &amp;quot;air&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fresh 
water&amp;quot; only just made the top 25,</text><text start="491.28" dur="2.8">and somehow the Earth&amp;#39;s 
magnetic field is at number 3.</text><text start="494.08" dur="3.28">And it&amp;#39;s at this point that I really 
start to doubt my own methodology.</text><text start="497.36" dur="1.84">Because at number two is electricity.</text><text start="499.76" dur="3.52">I do realise that using an 
electronic device to run this poll</text><text start="503.28" dur="3.44">does give that a certain 
advantage, but again,</text><text start="506.72" dur="1.52">should that really be higher than air?</text><text start="509.52" dur="1.52">Before we get to the best thing, though,</text><text start="511.04" dur="4.08">here are some other interesting 
results in specific categories:</text><text start="515.12" dur="2.24">the best part of the body is the brain.</text><text start="517.36" dur="3.76">&amp;quot;Space&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; both fought and won 
exactly the same number of match-ups,</text><text start="521.12" dur="2.8">they landed in joint 36th place.</text><text start="523.92" dur="3.12">Despite there being quite a few 
things about sex in the list,</text><text start="527.04" dur="2.16">none of them got near the top 50.</text><text start="529.2" dur="3.44">&amp;quot;Okay, okay, I should have checked more 
than the top 50 before recording this,</text><text start="532.64" dur="3.84">&amp;quot;&amp;#39;cos it turns out that the 
highest-rated sex thing is &amp;#39;orgasm&amp;#39;,</text><text start="536.48" dur="3.52">&amp;quot;and it got to number 69, and I 
swear I&amp;#39;m not making that up.&amp;quot;</text><text start="540" dur="4.96">The best creatures are bees, then 
emperor penguins, then hedgehogs.</text><text start="544.96" dur="3.76">The best colours are black, then 
blue, and the worst is brown.</text><text start="548.72" dur="3.28">Love doesn&amp;#39;t even make it into 
the top 100, it&amp;#39;s down at 137,</text><text start="552" dur="2.32">next to Vitamin C and cryptography,</text><text start="554.32" dur="3.36">and if that doesn&amp;#39;t prove my audience 
isn&amp;#39;t representative of the wider world,</text><text start="557.68" dur="1.36">I don&amp;#39;t know what does.</text><text start="559.04" dur="1.76">Actually, I do know what does,  </text><text start="560.8" dur="3.28">heterosexuality lost more 
than 50% of its match-ups,</text><text start="564.08" dur="3.84">while bisexuality was ranked 
only one item below doctors.</text><text start="567.92" dur="3.68">Yes, it is ridiculous to try 
and rank everything like this.</text><text start="571.6" dur="3.36">But the results do reveal things 
about this group of people,</text><text start="574.96" dur="2.32">about the folks who tend 
to watch videos like this.</text><text start="577.28" dur="3.6">And perhaps the most revealing 
thing is what placed first.</text><text start="580.88" dur="3.04">It doesn&amp;#39;t just tell you about the 
needs and desires of this audience,</text><text start="583.92" dur="2.64">it&amp;#39;s also something about 
the times we&amp;#39;re living in.</text><text start="586.56" dur="2.72">If we weren&amp;#39;t in what seems 
to be such a rough year,</text><text start="589.28" dur="3.68">if I were giving this talk to a live 
audience, like I originally planned to,</text><text start="592.96" dur="2.24">instead of a standing in 
front of a green screen and</text><text start="595.2" dur="2.32">talking to a camera in a tiny apartment,</text><text start="597.52" dur="2.88">well, then, in that case maybe the 
results would have been different.</text><text start="600.96" dur="4.56">But the best thing, according 
to this audience in mid-2020:</text><text start="605.52" dur="0.72">the best thing is...</text><text start="607.6" dur="0.5">sleep.</text><text start="608.64" dur="1.44">Have a good night, folks.</text><text start="610.08" dur="2.4">I ran the polling site for 
this video on Fasthosts,</text><text start="612.48" dur="3.04">a web hosting company with more 
than twenty years&amp;#39; experience.</text><text start="615.52" dur="4">Their dedicated servers can have up to
