she died of polio.</text><text start="7.95" dur="2.25">She couldn&amp;#39;t protect herself from viruses,</text><text start="10.2" dur="3.41">but you can protect your computer
by using a VPN.</text><text start="13.61" dur="4.51">Okay, look, I just want to say,
I do not want to start drama with</text><text start="18.12" dur="3.37">people who take sponsorships from VPN companies.</text><text start="21.49" dur="3.97">With a VPN, all the data you send and receive
goes through an encrypted tunnel,</text><text start="25.46" dur="1.32">so no-one can see it.</text><text start="26.78" dur="1.22">Without a VPN,</text><text start="28" dur="2.96">every time you connect to free wifi
in a hotel or a cafe,</text><text start="30.96" dur="2.28">you&amp;#39;re risking people stealing your passwords,</text><text start="33.24" dur="2.32">your banking details,
and your private data.</text><text start="35.56" dur="1.38">That&amp;#39;s not true.</text><text start="36.94" dur="3.66">You’ve probably seen the adverts at the
end of every educational channel’s videos,</text><text start="40.6" dur="0.96">and look,</text><text start="41.56" dur="3.22">it&amp;#39;s just that I do this sort of
computer security stuff,</text><text start="44.78" dur="2.69">I am supposed to know about it
and understand it.</text><text start="47.47" dur="2.81">Like, if I took a sponsorship
from a boat manufacturer</text><text start="50.28" dur="3.549">and then it turned out the boats sank,
that would suck,</text><text start="53.829" dur="1.98">but I&amp;#39;m not expected to know about boats.</text><text start="55.809" dur="3.711">I am expected to know about VPNs,
Virtual Private Networks.</text><text start="59.52" dur="4.7">And some of the claims that VPN adverts make
are wrong.</text><text start="64.22" dur="3.63">Password-stealing over wifi was a serious
threat, a few years ago.</text><text start="67.85" dur="2.03">Someone could run an ARP spoofing attack,</text><text start="69.88" dur="2.55">make their computer
pretend to be the network hub,</text><text start="72.43" dur="3.8">and steal every plain-text password that went
through that wifi network.</text><text start="76.23" dur="2.639">It required very little technical knowledge.</text><text start="78.869" dur="4.351">Or they could compromise the hub itself and
look at all the traffic that was going through it.</text><text start="83.22" dur="4">But you know what else sends data through
an encrypted tunnel?</text><text start="87.22" dur="2.14">Every single web site with a
padlock in the browser,</text><text start="89.36" dur="4.12">every iPhone app since 2016,
every Android app since 2018.</text><text start="93.49" dur="5.449">Anything that sends any sort of personal data
now uses a trusted encrypted tunnel, HTTPS,</text><text start="98.939" dur="1.18">that padlock,</text><text start="100.119" dur="3.221">and unless you’re using web sites or apps
from the past,</text><text start="103.34" dur="3.389">if anyone tries to intercept your data,
it won&amp;#39;t work.</text><text start="106.729" dur="3.091">Now, people on the network can see what sites
you&amp;#39;re connecting to,</text><text start="109.82" dur="2.089">so, just the name of your bank,</text><text start="111.909" dur="2.851">and they could see the contents
of dated web sites,</text><text start="114.76" dur="2.39">the ones where the browser now shows &amp;quot;Not
Secure&amp;quot;.</text><text start="117.15" dur="1.12">But that&amp;#39;s all.</text><text start="118.27" dur="2.09">No passwords, no bank details.</text><text start="120.36" dur="2.2">Those attacks don&amp;#39;t work any more.</text><text start="122.56" dur="3.12">One VPN company even had their advert banned
by the UK regulator</text><text start="125.68" dur="2.07">because of those misleading claims.</text><text start="127.75" dur="4.01">VPNs use military grade encryption to keep
your data safe.</text><text start="131.76" dur="2.4">Military-grade encryption means &amp;quot;AES&amp;quot;,</text><text start="134.17" dur="3.11">which is the same encryption that&amp;#39;s baked
into every web browser and app.</text><text start="137.28" dur="3.209">You&amp;#39;re using military-grade encryption to
watch this video.</text><text start="140.489" dur="2.871">The claim’s not wrong,
it&amp;#39;s just not special either.</text><text start="143.36" dur="5">Plus, a VPN stops your internet service provider
spying on what you&amp;#39;re doing online.</text><text start="148.36" dur="2.3">Now, that is true, to an extent.</text><text start="150.66" dur="1.26">Yes, without a VPN,</text><text start="151.93" dur="1.87">your internet service provider, your ISP,</text><text start="153.8" dur="2.69">can see what domain names
you&amp;#39;ve been connecting to.</text><text start="156.49" dur="3.15">There can be very good reasons to hide those.</text><text start="159.64" dur="3.14">Your country may allow ISPs to sell that data
to advertisers,</text><text start="162.79" dur="1.94">or to build up a profile on you.</text><text start="164.73" dur="2.75">Maybe you are studying at a fundamentalist
Christian college</text><text start="167.48" dur="4">and don&amp;#39;t want university administrators knowing
that you&amp;#39;re questioning your faith,</text><text start="171.48" dur="2.11">or questioning your sexuality.</text><text start="173.59" dur="4.07">Some ISPs also prioritise some apps, sites
and traffic types over others,</text><text start="177.66" dur="2.71">and a VPN means that they can’t do that.</text><text start="180.37" dur="2.29">Or maybe your government is planning to introduce</text><text start="182.66" dur="2.98">an ill-advised and often-delayed
block on adult content</text><text start="185.64" dur="1.66">and you want to work around it.</text><text start="187.3" dur="1.33">That&amp;#39;s all reasonable.</text><text start="188.63" dur="1.77">Metadata does give away a lot of information,</text><text start="190.4" dur="3.07">and wanting to keep that private
is a fair idea.</text><text start="193.47" dur="2.44">But that&amp;#39;s not what a lot of the VPN ads are
implying,</text><text start="195.91" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re implying that your ISP can read the
content of your messages.</text><text start="199.36" dur="2.08">And again, if there&amp;#39;s a padlock in the browser,</text><text start="201.44" dur="3.04">or if you’re using a modern app,
that&amp;#39;s not true.</text><text start="204.48" dur="4.44">And if you do use a VPN, all you&amp;#39;re doing
is changing who can see that metadata.</text><text start="208.92" dur="2.429">Your ISP can&amp;#39;t any more,
but the VPN company can</text><text start="211.349" dur="1.881">because at their end of the tunnel,</text><text start="213.23" dur="4.039">they have to look at that metadata
to work out where to send your traffic to.</text><text start="217.269" dur="1.44">But maybe that&amp;#39;s worth it for you.</text><text start="218.709" dur="1">And besides...</text><text start="219.709" dur="3.221">A good VPN doesn’t keep any logs of who
you&amp;#39;re talking to.</text><text start="222.93" dur="4.253">It is a brave move for a VPN not to keep any
logs, given that if that&amp;#39;s true,</text><text start="227.183" dur="3.446">their service will inevitably be used for
a lot of really awful illegal stuff.</text><text start="230.629" dur="3.64">Some do claim that, some have even brought
in independent auditors to try and prove</text><text start="234.269" dur="1.261">that they don&amp;#39;t keep any logs.</text><text start="235.53" dur="2.36">And you can’t have 100% certainty of that,</text><text start="237.89" dur="2.65">but they have got as close
as you reasonably can.</text><text start="240.54" dur="4.46">So if you&amp;#39;re planning an assassination and
your priority is absolutely covering your tracks,</text><text start="245" dur="2.42">then sure, I guess a VPN might be worth it.</text><text start="247.42" dur="5.08">But to customers, a VPN that
doesn&amp;#39;t keep logs is indistinguishable</text><text start="252.5" dur="2.34">from one that&amp;#39;s been compromised by hackers,</text><text start="254.84" dur="4.16">or that&amp;#39;s been given a little government
black box that they don&amp;#39;t understand</text><text start="259" dur="3.319">but they have to plug into their systems and
not tell anyone about.</text><text start="262.319" dur="3.82">Or from a VPN where a single employee has
been bribed</text><text start="266.139" dur="3.161">and has started logging things for just a
few accounts.</text><text start="269.3" dur="4.14">To be clear, I do not think any of the
VPN services are a front for the FBI,</text><text start="273.44" dur="4.72">or Russian mobsters, or some state-sponsored
plausibly-deniable intelligence operation.</text><text start="278.169" dur="4.831">Genuinely, they are almost certainly not,
and I do not want to scaremonger.</text><text start="283" dur="5.309">Any company that was found to be logging stuff
without permission would be bankrupt soon after,</text><text start="288.309" dur="2.07">it would be a very very bad business decision.</text><text start="290.379" dur="5.59">And the enormous amount of money that VPN
companies suddenly have probably comes from</text><text start="295.969" dur="1.931">overenthusiastic venture capital firms.</text><text start="297.9" dur="2.079">Actually, it almost certainly comes from them.</text><text start="299.979" dur="4.581">But if you wanted to see what the most paranoid,
security-conscious people are connecting to,</text><text start="304.56" dur="2.06">and you wanted to install software
on their systems</text><text start="306.62" dur="2.5">that is designed to read all their network traffic</text><text start="309.12" dur="3.46">and then redirect it through
a single choke point,</text><text start="312.58" dur="4.34">then setting up a VPN service with a huge
advertising budget would be a great way to do it.</text><text start="316.92" dur="3.4">And if you use a VPN, you can connect to streaming
services around the world,</text><text start="320.33" dur="1.639">as if you were in those countries!</text><text start="321.969" dur="2.17">And that&amp;#39;s the real reason a lot of people
use VPNs.</text><text start="324.139" dur="3.351">Are you going to China, or somewhere else
that blocks off access to a lot of web sites?</text><text start="327.49" dur="1">That&amp;#39;s a fair reason.</text><text start="328.49" dur="2.299">Do you want to watch another country&amp;#39;s streaming
content,</text><text start="330.789" dur="3.94">or download just enormous amounts of BitTorrents
without being tracked?</text><text start="334.729" dur="3.74">Those are valid uses of VPNs, even if they
are legally questionable.</text><text start="338.469" dur="3.301">It&amp;#39;s just that &amp;quot;great for pirating stuff and
getting around the law&amp;quot;</text><text start="341.77" dur="2.319">is the sort of marketing that gets a company
in trouble,</text><text start="344.089" dur="4.031">and &amp;quot;we stop bad people stealing your passwords&amp;quot;
is the sort of marketing</text><text start="348.12" dur="3.9">that scares people into buying something that
they might not need.</text><text start="352.02" dur="4.28">So, with that in mind, I wrote a more honest
advert for VPN services,</text><text start="356.3" dur="4.239">and I found a company that was willing to
sponsor the video.</text><text start="360.539" dur="2.13">Unfortunately, they kept asking for changes,</text><text start="362.669" dur="2.951">and we disagreed on those,
so at the last minute,</text><text start="365.62" dur="1.9">I have had to blank their name out.</text><text start="368.8" dur="2.5">Do you want your hide your sexuality from
your college administrators?</text><text start="371.3" dur="4.36">Do you want to download huge amounts of pirated
content with an extremely low,</text><text start="375.66" dur="2.589">but not zero, risk of being found out?</text><text start="378.249" dur="3.45">Are you planning an assassination and want
to hide your tracks?</text><text start="381.699" dur="2.17">Then you need [bleep] VPN,</text><text start="383.869" dur="2.741">the best choice for gay people, pirates, assassins,</text><text start="386.61" dur="2.22">and gay pirate assassins.</text><text start="388.83" dur="4.449">[bleep] VPN is a tool that can be used both
for good and evil,</text><text start="393.279" dur="3.12">and it&amp;#39;s extremely unlikely to be a front
for the FBI.</text><text start="396.399" dur="1.03">But you should know:</text><text start="397.429" dur="3.76">unless you are being personally targeted by
well-funded hackers using exploits that the</text><text start="401.189" dur="1.861">world doesn’t know about yet,</text><text start="403.05" dur="3.829">it doesn&amp;#39;t make your passwords and
financial data any more safe.</text><text start="406.879" dur="1.72">They’re already pretty safe.</text><text start="408.6" dur="4.7">And if you are being targeted by hackers like
that, you have bigger problems.</text><text start="413.3" dur="2.12">But if you want to hide your identity,</text><text start="415.429" dur="1.49">pretend you’re in another country,</text><text start="416.919" dur="1.981">or make sure your connection is secure as
you work out the</text><text start="418.9" dur="1.72">lethal doses of particular chemicals,</text><text start="420.62" dur="3.8">then go to [bleep].com/honest for [bleep]</text><text start="425.6" dur="2.72">That was a lot of money left on the table.</text><text start="428.32" dur="1.54">Lot of money.</text></transcript>
