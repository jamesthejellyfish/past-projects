It&amp;#39;s your boy Tom—</text><text start="13.9" dur="0.94">Oh, come on!</text><text start="14.84" dur="1.66">This video is sponsored by CuriosityStream,</text><text start="16.5" dur="2.7">and by this:

It&amp;#39;s your boy, TomReacts.</text><text start="24.98" dur="1.48">Let&amp;#39;s see what this prat has to say.</text><text start="26.46" dur="2.32">A few disclaimers before we start:</text><text start="28.78" dur="3.6">While this video has been proofed
and fact-checked by a team of legal experts,</text><text start="32.38" dur="3.06">I am not a lawyer, and this is not
a substitute for legal advice.</text><text start="35.44" dur="1.5">Yeah, I can tell that, mate.</text><text start="36.94" dur="4.34">I&amp;#39;m also talking a lot about YouTube and Google,
companies that I benefit from enormously.</text><text start="41.28" dur="2.74">Google even sponsored an entire series
on this channel last year.</text><text start="44.02" dur="1.08">Shill!</text><text start="45.1" dur="1.9">I&amp;#39;m friends with a few YouTube employees.</text><text start="47" dur="1.12">&amp;#39;Course you are.</text><text start="48.12" dur="3.86">So, while all the words here are my own,
YouTube don&amp;#39;t even know I&amp;#39;m making this,</text><text start="51.98" dur="2.14">you should know that
if you&amp;#39;re one of the outliers</text><text start="54.12" dur="3.5">who&amp;#39;s been screwed over by
YouTube&amp;#39;s copyright system…</text><text start="57.62" dur="3">Yeah, you will probably have
a different view of parts of this.</text><text start="60.62" dur="2.8">Although I hope you&amp;#39;ll still agree
with my conclusion.</text><text start="63.42" dur="2.26">With all that said,
enjoy the show.</text><text start="65.68" dur="1.28">Get on with it!</text><text start="66.96" dur="0.88">Not you.</text><text start="73.58" dur="3.3">I realise saying
&amp;quot;YouTube&amp;#39;s Copyright System Isn&amp;#39;t Broken&amp;quot;</text><text start="76.88" dur="2.18">is a controversial claim to make,</text><text start="79.06" dur="2.44">when every week
there seems to be a new headline</text><text start="81.5" dur="2.84">about how a YouTube creator
is being screwed over</text><text start="84.34" dur="5.2">by false copyright claims, or mistaken identity,
or deliberate copyright abuse.</text><text start="89.54" dur="2.38">I&amp;#39;m not saying
that the system is perfect.</text><text start="91.92" dur="3.22">It&amp;#39;s far from perfect,
and I&amp;#39;ll talk about that too.</text><text start="95.14" dur="3.08">But I don&amp;#39;t think
it&amp;#39;s fundamentally broken.</text><text start="98.22" dur="2.94">In May 2019, a YouTube
Minecraft player called Oli</text><text start="101.16" dur="3.42">had hundreds of his videos claimed
by music label Warner Chappell</text><text start="104.58" dur="2.18">using YouTube&amp;#39;s Content ID system.</text><text start="106.76" dur="3.42">His post about it made a lot of people
righteously angry.</text><text start="110.18" dur="3.74">He&amp;#39;d got permission to use a track from
an independent composer as his intro music,</text><text start="113.92" dur="4.48">and now a big corporation was
claiming every video and taking all his revenue!</text><text start="118.4" dur="4.34">Popular websites went so far as to claim
that Oli was the victim of outright theft,</text><text start="122.74" dur="4.48">since 25% of his revenues
were directed to Warner Chappell.</text><text start="127.22" dur="3.02">But the follow-up wasn&amp;#39;t seen
by nearly as many people:</text><text start="130.24" dur="2.74">those claims were entirely legitimate.</text><text start="132.98" dur="3.24">Yes, Oli got permission
to use that music from its composer,</text><text start="136.22" dur="2.62">but that composer had sampled
another piece of music</text><text start="138.84" dur="4.04">that was owned by Warner Chappell,
without a license.</text><text start="142.88" dur="3.48">So the permission that Oli got
was entirely useless.</text><text start="146.36" dur="3.36">Warner Chappell was right,
and Oli was wrong.</text><text start="149.72" dur="1.58">So, here&amp;#39;s how
that should have worked</text><text start="151.3" dur="3.56">in the world that current copyright law
was designed for:</text><text start="154.86" dur="4.7">First, everyone involved would have been
part of a large company with a legal team.</text><text start="159.56" dur="4.12">Lawyers from the music label would have contacted
the lawyers for the video company,</text><text start="163.68" dur="4.48">and they would have said, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s going on?
You didn&amp;#39;t license that.&amp;quot;</text><text start="168.16" dur="2.18">And the video company lawyers
would have gone:</text><text start="170.34" dur="2.2">&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFF00&quot;&gt;Oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry. I had no idea.&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="172.54" dur="2.34">&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFF00&quot;&gt;We bought that license in good faith
from a third party.&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="174.88" dur="1.26">&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFF00&quot;&gt;We should both talk to them.&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="176.14" dur="3.96">At which point the third company&amp;#39;s lawyers
would get a very worrying phone call.</text><text start="180.1" dur="1.94">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;[screams]&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="182.04" dur="3.06">And all the mess would almost certainly
have been settled out of court.</text><text start="185.1" dur="1.26">Maybe by backroom dealings,</text><text start="186.36" dur="2.68">maybe by teams of lawyers
sending formal letters to each other.</text><text start="189.04" dur="2.56">That was the world
that copyright law was designed for.</text><text start="191.6" dur="2.22">Because individuals couldn&amp;#39;t make things</text><text start="193.82" dur="2.96">that were viewed by millions
without corporate support,</text><text start="196.78" dur="3.58">you needed a publisher, or a broadcaster,
or a huge production company,</text><text start="200.36" dur="3.3">and… those companies had lawyers.</text><text start="203.66" dur="3.16">The world has moved on,
and copyright law hasn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="206.82" dur="2.2">And the result is that,
when something like this happens</text><text start="209.02" dur="3.9">in the world of relatively-tiny,
independent online creators,</text><text start="212.92" dur="3.9">we have to work around
what the law is meant to do.</text><text start="217" dur="3">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Canon in D by Pachelbel]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="221.36" dur="4.42">Music has two main copyrights.</text><text start="225.78" dur="2.98">First, there&amp;#39;s the copyright
on the composition itself:</text><text start="228.76" dur="3.34">all the parts of a work
that can be written down,</text><text start="232.1" dur="2.4">so, lyrics and notes.</text><text start="235.74" dur="6.04">And then, second, there&amp;#39;s a copyright on
each individual recorded performance.</text><text start="243.04" dur="3.98">So I can sit here, and I can play
Pachelbel&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Canon in D&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="247.02" dur="2.64">without having to pay any licensing fees,</text><text start="249.66" dur="5.12">because Pachelbel died in 1706
and his work is now in the public domain,</text><text start="254.78" dur="2.72">in the pool of works
where the copyright has expired.</text><text start="257.5" dur="4.24">His music is now free for anyone to use
without payment and without credit.</text><text start="261.74" dur="2.1">Which is brilliant!</text><text start="263.84" dur="1.84">But if I&amp;#39;m not playing it,</text><text start="265.68" dur="2.7">I&amp;#39;m actually using a modern recording of it…
</text><text start="267" dur="1.6">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;[music continues]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="268.38" dur="2.82">…then it doesn&amp;#39;t matter that
the composition is in the public domain:</text><text start="269.5" dur="2.2">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;[music stops]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="271.2" dur="2.38">someone has added
their own hard work playing it,</text><text start="273.58" dur="2.22">along with the work of a production team
making it sound good,</text><text start="275.8" dur="3.08">and that recording is
under a separate copyright</text><text start="278.88" dur="2.9">that needs licensing to use
in a video like this.</text><text start="281.78" dur="3.66">Songwriter after songwriter after songwriter
has used Pachelbel&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Canon in D&lt;/i&gt;</text><text start="285.44" dur="1.94">to the extent that it&amp;#39;s now a cliché,</text><text start="287.38" dur="3.18">and no-one&amp;#39;s had to pay Pachelbel
or his family a penny in centuries,</text><text start="290.56" dur="4.08">but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean any of the modern songs
based on it are in the public domain.</text><text start="294.64" dur="1.42">There is new work there.</text><text start="296.06" dur="3.76">And I can&amp;#39;t use those modern songs
in this video to demonstrate that,</text><text start="299.82" dur="2.82">unless I&amp;#39;m actually criticising them.</text><text start="302.64" dur="1.22">On that point…</text><text start="303.86" dur="2.4">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;♫♫&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="303.86" dur="2.4">Maroon 5&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Memories&lt;/i&gt; 
is an infuriating composition</text><text start="306.26" dur="2.44">that uses the start of the melody
of &lt;i&gt;Canon in D&lt;/i&gt; but never resolves it,</text><text start="308.7" dur="2">which means it has the same
stuck-in-your-head effect</text><text start="310.7" dur="2.04">as the jingle from
Alfred Bester&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Demolished Man&lt;/i&gt;,</text><text start="312.74" dur="1.5">and I hate it.</text><text start="314.24" dur="2.54">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;♫♫&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="314.24" dur="2.54">Coolio&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;C U When U Get There&lt;/i&gt; 
was a lukewarm lead single</text><text start="316.78" dur="2.28">from a third album that obviously did
far better with a naive world audience</text><text start="319.06" dur="2.14">than it ever did
with its actual target market.</text><text start="321.2" dur="2.2">There&amp;#39;s a reason it went platinum
in New Zealand.</text><text start="323.4" dur="2.84">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;♫♫&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="323.4" dur="2.84">And The Farm&amp;#39;s
&lt;i&gt;All Together Now&lt;/i&gt; is…</text><text start="326.24" dur="1.14">actually a pretty good song</text><text start="327.38" dur="1.78">despite the incongruity between
its subject matter and its style,</text><text start="329.16" dur="1.82">but it&amp;#39;s been completely destroyed</text><text start="330.98" dur="3.12">by repetitive and unnecessary
cover versions and football chants.</text><text start="334.84" dur="2.1">Criticism and review!
There we go.</text><text start="336.94" dur="2.98">That is the sort of thing that&amp;#39;s considered
&amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot; under US law,</text><text start="339.92" dur="2.92">and &amp;quot;fair dealing&amp;quot;
under the much more strict UK law,</text><text start="342.84" dur="2.5">but I had to censor the album art
of those songs,</text><text start="345.34" dur="2.68">because I wasn&amp;#39;t criticising
and reviewing the art,</text><text start="348.02" dur="3.14">and the art is covered
under separate copyright.</text><text start="351.16" dur="3.44">In 2009, Andy Baio,
then one of the directors of Kickstarter,</text><text start="354.6" dur="4.22">released an 8-bit chiptune version
of the best-selling jazz album of all time,</text><text start="358.82" dur="1.62">Miles Davis&amp;#39; &lt;i&gt;Kind of Blue&lt;/i&gt;.</text><text start="360.44" dur="2.94">He got a license from the music publisher.
He called it &lt;i&gt;Kind of Bloop&lt;/i&gt;.</text><text start="363.38" dur="1.58">It was all above board.</text><text start="364.96" dur="4.34">But he settled out of court
for more than $30,000 with Jay Maisel,</text><text start="369.3" dur="3.78">the photographer who took the iconic photograph
on the original album cover.</text><text start="373.08" dur="3.8">&lt;i&gt;Kind of Bloop&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#39;s album art was
a pixelated version of that album cover.</text><text start="376.88" dur="2.02">Baio thought it was fair use.</text><text start="378.9" dur="3.28">Maisel said it wasn&amp;#39;t,
and Maisel had lawyers.</text><text start="382.18" dur="0.92">To quote Baio:</text><text start="383.1" dur="2.96">&amp;quot;The fact that I settled
is not an admission of guilt.</text><text start="386.06" dur="3.66">&amp;quot;This was the least expensive
option available.&amp;quot;</text><text start="389.72" dur="4.88">Because copyright lawyers and
copyright lawsuits are very, very expensive.</text><text start="394.6" dur="2.64">Expensive enough that
that isn&amp;#39;t the album cover!</text><text start="397.24" dur="2.46">That is a stock photo
that looks kind-of like the album cover,</text><text start="399.7" dur="2.76">because I am taking no risks.</text><text start="402.46" dur="2.64">I don&amp;#39;t know if that pixel art was fair use.</text><text start="405.1" dur="5.16">If someone took your greatest work,
ran it through a pixelation filter, and then sold it,</text><text start="410.26" dur="2.84">I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s entirely unreasonable
to think you&amp;#39;ve been ripped off.</text><text start="413.1" dur="2.46">The line of &amp;#39;fair use&amp;#39; is very fuzzy,</text><text start="415.56" dur="3.18">and both sides can have
very strong and conflicting arguments.</text><text start="418.74" dur="2.32">That&amp;#39;s the job of the courts to solve.</text><text start="421.06" dur="2">If both sides can afford it.</text><text start="423.06" dur="1.7">And there wasn&amp;#39;t even a music video
involved there!</text><text start="424.76" dur="1.8">That is a whole separate problem.</text><text start="426.56" dur="2.98">There is something
called a &amp;#39;compulsory license&amp;#39;</text><text start="429.54" dur="2.54">for selling and performing just music,</text><text start="432.08" dur="3.1">but if you want to publish a video
to go with someone else&amp;#39;s song,</text><text start="435.18" dur="3.6">even if it&amp;#39;s just a video of you
performing it on a ukelele in your bedroom,</text><text start="438.78" dur="2.8">that requires a separate
synchronisation license,</text><text start="441.58" dur="4.2">and the copyright holder has
an absolute right to say no to that.</text><text start="445.78" dur="2.32">YouTube has always had
a lot of people uploading cover songs,</text><text start="448.1" dur="2.08">singing and performing
the music that they love,</text><text start="450.18" dur="1.9">and hoping they&amp;#39;ll get noticed.</text><text start="452.08" dur="2.14">By talent scouts, not by lawyers.</text><text start="454.22" dur="3.2">A lot of modern pop singers
got their start on YouTube,</text><text start="457.42" dur="3.26">but the legal baseline for doing that
outside the YouTube bubble,</text><text start="460.68" dur="3.4">if you just filmed yourself
and put it up somewhere else online…</text><text start="464.08" dur="2.7">Well, the baseline is that
you&amp;#39;d have to pay for an expensive license,</text><text start="466.78" dur="2.22">or you get sued, and you lose.</text><text start="469" dur="1.82">Or more likely,
you get a cease-and-desist letter,</text><text start="470.82" dur="1.8">you pay a bit of money
to make the lawyers go away,</text><text start="472.62" dur="3.54">and you drop out of
the music industry, disillusioned.</text><text start="476.16" dur="3.18">And you can&amp;#39;t get away with it
by changing the lyrics.</text><text start="479.34" dur="4.06">A parody is probably not &amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot;
unless you&amp;#39;re directly criticising the original,</text><text start="483.4" dur="1.62">and even then, it&amp;#39;s questionable.</text><text start="485.02" dur="3.24">&amp;#39;Weird&amp;#39; Al Yankovic,
the most popular parody artist in history,</text><text start="488.26" dur="2">licenses the songs that he parodies.</text><text start="490.26" dur="2.8">There are lots of lengthy law journal articles
asking whether he needs to,</text><text start="493.06" dur="2.28">but… it&amp;#39;s better safe than sorry,</text><text start="495.34" dur="3.64">and yeah, I wouldn&amp;#39;t fancy his chances
if it actually went to court.</text><text start="498.98" dur="3.58">The worst-case scenario of doing
an unlicensed song parody on YouTube</text><text start="502.56" dur="2.7">is that you get sued, and you lose.</text><text start="505.26" dur="2.94">Because under current copyright law,
you are in the wrong.</text><text start="508.2" dur="2.12">I&amp;#39;m not saying that&amp;#39;s how it should be.</text><text start="510.32" dur="1.72">I&amp;#39;m saying that&amp;#39;s how it is.</text><text start="512.04" dur="4.16">And most people won&amp;#39;t have the money
to even start to defend a case like that.</text><text start="516.2" dur="3.5">Now, YouTube has a workaround for this,
Content ID, I&amp;#39;ll get to that later.</text><text start="519.7" dur="2.34">And if you&amp;#39;re not actually using
the original piece,</text><text start="522.04" dur="2.18">if you&amp;#39;re just…
reminding the viewer of it,</text><text start="524.22" dur="2.54">just getting close enough
in your parody,</text><text start="526.76" dur="2.1">then you&amp;#39;re probably in the clear.</text><text start="528.86" dur="3.86">YouTube creators who change
just the lyrics of songs to do parodies</text><text start="532.72" dur="3.92">often say, &amp;quot;Oh, but it&amp;#39;s transformative!
It&amp;#39;s fair use, it&amp;#39;s for criticism!</text><text start="536.64" dur="3.34">&amp;quot;They can&amp;#39;t claim copyright over it!
They&amp;#39;re making a false…</text><text start="538.6" dur="1.38">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;[hits piano]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</text><text start="539.98" dur="1.36">They&amp;#39;re making a false claim!&amp;quot;
And…</text><text start="541.34" dur="4.12">Look, if you&amp;#39;re taking a Katy Perry song
and changing the words</text><text start="545.46" dur="3.46">to be about something other than
criticising Katy Perry or the song itself,</text><text start="548.92" dur="1.72">it&amp;#39;s likely not fair use.</text><text start="550.64" dur="3.34">The same way that big movie companies
can&amp;#39;t take small songwriters&amp;#39; work,</text><text start="553.98" dur="2.78">change the lyrics, and put the result
in movies without paying and say,</text><text start="556.76" dur="3.24">&amp;quot;Oh, but&amp;#39;s transformative, it&amp;#39;s fair use.
Look, we changed the lyrics.&amp;quot;</text><text start="560" dur="4.42">And it may seem unfair that the law holds
kids on YouTube messing around</text><text start="564.42" dur="3.26">to more or less the same legal standard
as Hollywood studios.</text><text start="567.68" dur="2.86">In public opinion,
there&amp;#39;s definitely a big difference there:</text><text start="570.54" dur="5.16">People smile at small creators taking content
from big companies well outside fair use,</text><text start="575.7" dur="1.62">but never the other way around.</text><text start="577.32" dur="2.32">And that&amp;#39;s the reason that
some small-time reaction YouTuber…</text><text start="579.64" dur="1.3">Hey! Hey!</text><text start="580.94" dur="3.88">can take a five-second clip from a movie
and use it for a cheap punchline,</text><text start="584.82" dur="2.44">even if it&amp;#39;s not criticism and review…</text><text start="587.26" dur="3.8">but I&amp;#39;m damn sure if a movie studio
took a clip of a reaction channel&amp;#39;s video</text><text start="591.06" dur="1.58">and used it in a film without permission,</text><text start="592.64" dur="2.4">there would be lawyers lining up
to take the case.</text><text start="595.04" dur="2.2">Yeah, you&amp;#39;re right.
This is my content, I own it!</text><text start="597.24" dur="1.82">You hear that, Disney? Right.</text><text start="599.06" dur="3.22">Remember, tomorrow I&amp;#39;m reacting
to the new &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; trailer.</text><text start="602.28" dur="2.4">Maybe there should be
different treatment there.</text><text start="604.68" dur="3.46">But in current copyright law,
there isn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="612.26" dur="4.48">If you take a photograph off a stock image site,
or from some photographer&amp;#39;s Flickr account,</text><text start="616.74" dur="3.54">and you just copy it into your blog post
or your company website,</text><text start="620.28" dur="3.56">you might well get an email
from a service called Pixsy.</text><text start="623.84" dur="1.88">They use automatic systems
to scan the web,</text><text start="625.72" dur="2.64">detect people who&amp;#39;ve used photographs
without permission,</text><text start="628.36" dur="4.94">and then they send legal letters
threatening court action and demanding payment.</text><text start="633.3" dur="2.38">And legally, they are in the right.</text><text start="635.68" dur="2.68">They&amp;#39;re using strong-arm tactics
and they&amp;#39;re in it for the money—</text><text start="638.36" dur="2.34">and in some cases,
they are threatening someone</text><text start="640.7" dur="2.96">who has absolutely no idea
about copyright,</text><text start="643.66" dur="2.88">and genuinely thinks that
stuff on the web is free to take.</text><text start="646.54" dur="2.64">There are lots of threads online
with people going,</text><text start="649.18" dur="3.7">&amp;quot;Agh, what&amp;#39;s— what&amp;#39;s happening?
I didn&amp;#39;t know, how do I make this go away?&amp;quot;</text><text start="652.88" dur="2.68">To which the answer is: pay up.</text><text start="655.56" dur="2.5">Photography is an art,
and an expensive one,</text><text start="658.06" dur="3.82">and yeah, until we live in magical
post-scarcity &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; space communism,</text><text start="661.88" dur="5.36">you shouldn&amp;#39;t just be able to rip off
a photographer&amp;#39;s copyrighted work and use it.</text><text start="667.24" dur="3.4">Except, that&amp;#39;s what the Internet does.
A lot.</text><text start="670.64" dur="1.18">Heck, I used to do it.</text><text start="671.82" dur="1.82">It&amp;#39;s gone from the Internet now,
for obvious reasons,</text><text start="673.64" dur="3.38">but when I was younger,
I unashamedly took images</text><text start="677.02" dur="2.18">and other stuff from the web
and repurposed it,</text><text start="679.2" dur="3.88">because I knew hardly anyone would see it,
even fewer people would care,</text><text start="683.08" dur="4.32">and the worst case scenario
was that I&amp;#39;d get a cease-and-desist letter.</text><text start="687.4" dur="2.44">and if that happened,
I might be able to cry &amp;#39;censorship&amp;#39;</text><text start="689.84" dur="1.82">and get some publicity out of it.</text><text start="691.66" dur="1.56">I&amp;#39;ve grown up since then,</text><text start="693.22" dur="4.36">but there are a whole new wave of kids
who have that same philosophy.</text><text start="697.58" dur="2.76">&amp;quot;No copyright infringement intended&amp;quot;,

some stock photography a few years ago.</text><text start="724.42" dur="3.32">He doesn&amp;#39;t have rights over his face
or image in any of these photos,</text><text start="727.74" dur="2.34">he signed those away
as part of the photography contract.</text><text start="730.08" dur="3.86">And while there is a discussion
to be had about personality rights</text><text start="733.94" dur="4.58">and the ethics of taking some random person&amp;#39;s face
and using it without context,</text><text start="738.52" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s not relevant here.
What is relevant is the copyright on that photo.</text><text start="743.08" dur="2.6">If you&amp;#39;re criticising or commenting
on the photo itself,</text><text start="745.68" dur="3.66">if you&amp;#39;re judging the composition,
the camerawork, or…</text><text start="749.34" dur="2.34">yes, the incredibly awkward expression</text><text start="751.68" dur="3">that meant he gained
the nickname &amp;quot;Hide the Pain Harold&amp;quot;</text><text start="754.68" dur="3.82">and became one of the most-recognised figures
in the nerdy underbelly of the Internet,</text><text start="758.5" dur="2.6">then yes, that may well be acceptable.</text><text start="761.1" dur="3.64">But if you&amp;#39;re just using those pictures
as a stock image</text><text start="764.74" dur="2.58">to make a point about anything else,</text><text start="767.32" dur="4.74">then you&amp;#39;d better have a license
or you&amp;#39;re exposing yourself to a lot of legal liability.</text><text start="772.06" dur="4.4">When big publications talk about
the &amp;quot;distracted boyfriend&amp;quot; picture, they license it.</text><text start="776.46" dur="4.06">There is no exception, under law, for:
&amp;quot;I just put it in my video as a quick joke!&amp;quot;</text><text start="780.52" dur="2.6">I licensed all those photos
from a company called Shutterstock,</text><text start="783.12" dur="1.74">here&amp;#39;s the license agreement.</text><text start="784.86" dur="4.16">Actually, I got a bundle deal of image credits
from them because it was cheaper,</text><text start="789.02" dur="1.98">and I had some of those credits left over,</text><text start="791" dur="3.3">so please now enjoy
a few inexplicable stock photos</text><text start="794.3" dur="2.32">that I also now have
the legal right to use.</text><text start="804.3" dur="3.18">Anyway, the photographer who took
that original &amp;quot;distracted boyfriend&amp;quot; picture</text><text start="807.48" dur="4.56">was asked how he felt about his work
being used everywhere without permission.</text><text start="812.04" dur="3.64">And he said: &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re just a group of people
doing it in good faith.</text><text start="815.68" dur="3.44">&amp;quot;We are not going to take any action,
except for the extreme cases</text><text start="819.12" dur="3.64">in which this good faith doesn&amp;#39;t exist.&amp;quot;</text><text start="822.76" dur="2.52">That is an act of generosity
on his part.</text><text start="825.28" dur="3.26">He would be entirely within his rights
to hire a service like Pixsy,</text><text start="828.54" dur="2.82">let them play the bad guys,
and rake in a lot of money,</text><text start="831.36" dur="3.48">and if you think that&amp;#39;s wrong,
then talk to a professional photographer.</text><text start="834.84" dur="3.02">Ask them how they earn their living,
and how much their equipment costs,</text><text start="837.86" dur="2.28">and how they&amp;#39;d feel about it.</text><text start="840.14" dur="4.16">Now as I record this, Pixsy doesn&amp;#39;t appear
to have automated systems</text><text start="844.3" dur="4.16">hunting through YouTube videos to find
unlicensed images and send out legal threats,</text><text start="848.46" dur="3">but… they could. Pretty easily.</text><text start="851.46" dur="2.9">Maybe those claims could be
defended in court with enough money,</text><text start="854.36" dur="3.36">but in the current system,
most people would be forced to fold,</text><text start="857.72" dur="2.26">and pay a license fee,
and give up.</text><text start="859.98" dur="3.06">And viral-video licensing companies
like Jukin Media</text><text start="863.04" dur="3.5">do already search through YouTube for
unlicensed use of the video clips they own,</text><text start="866.54" dur="3.46">and while as a company they are vilified
by the creator community,</text><text start="870" dur="2.52">they&amp;#39;ve, um… they&amp;#39;ve got a point.</text><text start="872.52" dur="2.72">Creators have the right to determine
how their work is being used,</text><text start="875.24" dur="3.12">and taking someone else&amp;#39;s
copyrighted photos or videos,</text><text start="878.36" dur="2.92">and using them commercially,
without permission, without criticism,</text><text start="881.28" dur="2.04">is not fair use under the law.</text><text start="883.32" dur="2.1">Even if loads of other people
have already used them.</text><text start="885.42" dur="3.64">Even if you add some words on top of them.
Even if you mash them up with three other things.</text><text start="889.06" dur="4.6">Are you 100% sure that you are transforming
or criticising the original,</text><text start="893.66" dur="1.2">not just using it?</text><text start="894.86" dur="3.38">And are you 100% sure
that a court would agree with you?</text><text start="898.24" dur="2.18">And just to repeat:
I&amp;#39;m not saying this is how it should be.</text><text start="900.42" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;m saying: this is how it is.</text><text start="903.48" dur="3.54">But that&amp;#39;s pictures and videos.
What about bits of pop culture?</text><text start="907.02" dur="4.24">At the end of 2019, Giphy,
a GIF-aggregation site, briefly removed…</text><text start="911.26" dur="1.6">Actually, hold on.
People will complain.</text><text start="912.86" dur="3.32">I&amp;#39;m pronouncing it /ɡɪf/ because Giphy,
the site I&amp;#39;m talking about, pronounces it /ɡɪf/.</text><text start="916.18" dur="2.08">And besides, the real problem
is that they&amp;#39;re not actually GIFs,</text><text start="918.26" dur="1.52">they&amp;#39;re short video files
in other formats.</text><text start="919.78" dur="2.28">GIF is a really specific descriptor
for a data format.</text><text start="922.06" dur="3.08">Short looping videos are not GIFs,
but apparently now they are!</text><text start="925.14" dur="1.98">It&amp;#39;s like how &amp;quot;emoji&amp;quot; now refers to
any small image.</text><text start="927.12" dur="2.58">I&amp;#39;m still grumpy about all of this.
Don&amp;#39;t @ me. Anyway.</text><text start="929.7" dur="3.5">At the end of 2019, Giphy briefly removed
its many, many GIFs</text><text start="933.2" dur="1.7">of The Child from &lt;i&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/i&gt;,</text><text start="934.9" dur="2.34">a creature designed to be so adorable
that I can only assume</text><text start="937.24" dur="3.48">the design came directly from
Disney&amp;#39;s merchandising team.</text><text start="940.72" dur="2.94">Those GIFs were removed
because of what Giphy described as</text><text start="943.66" dur="3.04">&amp;quot;confusion about certain content&amp;quot;.</text><text start="946.7" dur="2.26">I&amp;#39;d guess they got a legal letter
from someone at Disney,</text><text start="948.96" dur="2.58">before Disney realised
what a PR disaster it would be</text><text start="951.54" dur="3.44">to stop the Internet having
immediate access to Baby Yoda.</text><text start="954.98" dur="5.4">But the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; article about that brief takedown
has a really interesting final line:</text><text start="960.38" dur="5.52">&amp;quot;Images in GIFs are widely understood
to fall under the &amp;#39;fair use&amp;#39; exception.&amp;quot;</text><text start="965.9" dur="2.82">Notice how that&amp;#39;s phrased:
&amp;quot;Widely understood.&amp;quot;</text><text start="968.72" dur="3.94">There has never been a court case about this.
Are GIFs fair use?</text><text start="973.66" dur="2.02">I actually think that, if some company
got a bee in their bonnet,</text><text start="975.68" dur="2.28">the same way they did about Napster
twenty years ago,</text><text start="977.96" dur="3.38">and if they insisted on litigating
all the way to court,</text><text start="981.34" dur="2.64">it is entirely possible
that a judge would go,</text><text start="983.98" dur="4.34">&amp;quot;No, GIFs aren&amp;#39;t a parody, they&amp;#39;re not criticism,
they&amp;#39;re not transformative, they&amp;#39;re not fair use.</text><text start="988.32" dur="4.12">&amp;quot;Giphy&amp;#39;s entire product, the GIF economy,
is based on systematic copyright infringement.</text><text start="992.44" dur="2.02">&amp;quot;Pay the money, shut it down.&amp;quot;</text><text start="994.46" dur="2">In practice, of course,
it wouldn&amp;#39;t get that far.</text><text start="996.46" dur="3.04">Giphy would accept a cease-and-desist
and take down what was complained about.</text><text start="999.5" dur="2.22">It&amp;#39;s just easier,
because remember,</text><text start="1001.72" dur="2.86">they&amp;#39;re not an individual creator
or a small site.</text><text start="1004.58" dur="2.36">Giphy has an enormous office
in New York</text><text start="1006.94" dur="4.2">with catered lunches and arcade games
for more than 100 employees…</text><text start="1011.14" dur="3.66">based on a business model that is
arguably copyright infringement.</text><text start="1014.8" dur="4.32">I am amazed that no big media corporations
have looked at their money and gone…</text><text start="1019.12" dur="1.84">&amp;quot;We can sue them for that!&amp;quot;</text><text start="1021.62" dur="3.02">In the same way, uploading
video game footage to YouTube</text><text start="1024.64" dur="4.58">is &amp;quot;widely understood&amp;quot; to be okay,
but that&amp;#39;s questionable.</text><text start="1029.22" dur="5.06">Maybe if it&amp;#39;s something like Minecraft,
where there&amp;#39;s a lot of original work, it could be.</text><text start="1034.28" dur="4">And besides, the license agreement
that you accept when playing Minecraft</text><text start="1038.28" dur="2.62">allows streaming
and most YouTube videos.</text><text start="1040.9" dur="2.38">But if it&amp;#39;s just a video of cutscenes,</text><text start="1043.28" dur="1.8">or following roughly the same
sequence of events</text><text start="1045.08" dur="2.12">that every player would follow,</text><text start="1047.2" dur="3.38">it&amp;#39;s a bit like putting up a video
of you watching a TV show.</text><text start="1050.58" dur="2.68">We&amp;#39;ve seen companies decide
in the past that…</text><text start="1053.26" dur="3.02">actually, they don&amp;#39;t want
videos of their games online.</text><text start="1056.28" dur="4.62">It is very easy to make the argument
that online streaming of games affects sales.</text><text start="1060.9" dur="2.22">And the impact on sales
is a key component</text><text start="1063.12" dur="1.96">in determining whether something
is fair use.</text><text start="1065.08" dur="3.72">Sure, the games get some exposure,
but exposure doesn&amp;#39;t pay the rent.</text><text start="1068.8" dur="3.4">I didn&amp;#39;t buy &lt;i&gt;Untitled Goose Game&lt;/i&gt;
and experience the beautiful artwork</text><text start="1072.2" dur="2.58">and immaculately-timed
comic setpieces myself.</text><text start="1074.78" dur="2.2">I skipped through a couple of videos
so I could get the jokes,</text><text start="1076.98" dur="1.64">and then I moved on.</text><text start="1078.62" dur="1.7">I didn&amp;#39;t buy &lt;i&gt;Superliminal&lt;/i&gt; either.</text><text start="1080.32" dur="3.8">I just watched a video of someone
playing it to get how it works,</text><text start="1084.12" dur="2.72">skipped forward to see how it ends,
and then I got on with my life.</text><text start="1086.84" dur="2.48">And I&amp;#39;m glad I did,
the game mechanics are clever…</text><text start="1089.32" dur="2.08">but the ending is unsatisfying.</text><text start="1091.4" dur="3.3">Or maybe I just think that
because I watched someone else play it.</text><text start="1094.7" dur="4.46">And that someone else, who provided
a substitute for the original product,</text><text start="1099.16" dur="4.18">made money off that, either from
advertising or streaming donations.</text><text start="1103.34" dur="2.52">Now, video game streaming
might be fair use</text><text start="1105.86" dur="4.38">if you&amp;#39;ve got someone constantly criticising
and reviewing the work as they play it.</text><text start="1110.24" dur="4.32">Not just talking about it, or not just
repeating what they&amp;#39;re saying in the game,</text><text start="1114.56" dur="3.06">or saying hi to the chat,
like actively criticising.</text><text start="1117.62" dur="2.12">Maybe.
It would be up to a judge to decide,</text><text start="1119.74" dur="1.64">and no-one wants any case like that
to get to court,</text><text start="1121.38" dur="2.58">because somehow
we have an entire industry</text><text start="1123.96" dur="3">based around something that is
very possibly copyright infringement,</text><text start="1126.96" dur="3.46">but which most video game publishers
are just going along with.</text><text start="1130.42" dur="2.2">Perhaps because they genuinely think
it&amp;#39;s a good thing,</text><text start="1132.62" dur="2.96">or perhaps… because they&amp;#39;ve seen
the backlash that happens</text><text start="1135.58" dur="5.14">when horrible gamer children are suddenly
denied something they think is their right.</text><text start="1140.72" dur="2.4">Like our friend in the corner.</text><text start="1143.12" dur="3.4">Hey, this is transformative.
This is definitely fair use.</text><text start="1146.52" dur="2.22">Would you do this
to a Marvel movie, though?</text><text start="1148.74" dur="2.72">No, mate. They&amp;#39;d sue me for
every penny I&amp;#39;ve got.</text><text start="1152.221" dur="5.939">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;♪ In the not-too-distant future,

&lt;i&gt;Mystery Science Theater 3000&lt;/i&gt;,</text><text start="1165.28" dur="1.98">which was basically a reaction channel.</text><text start="1167.26" dur="1.82">A host, along with a cast of puppet robots,</text><text start="1169.08" dur="3.06">would watch a full-length movie,
usually an old science fiction piece.</text><text start="1172.14" dur="3.34">They&amp;#39;d be in silhouette, as if they were
in the row of cinema seats in front of you,</text><text start="1175.48" dur="3.1">constantly cracking jokes about
whatever was on screen.</text><text start="1178.58" dur="2.9">It&amp;#39;s tightly written, scripted with
joke after joke after joke,</text><text start="1181.48" dur="2.46">although the skits that
surround the movie</text><text start="1183.94" dur="2.68">are often so laden with in-jokes
and character shtick</text><text start="1186.62" dur="4.44">that new viewers who don&amp;#39;t know
the show and the cast can be completely lost.</text><text start="1191.06" dur="2.44">Like I said:
it&amp;#39;s basically a reaction channel.</text><text start="1193.5" dur="5">&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine listed &lt;i&gt;Mystery Science Theater&lt;/i&gt; as
one of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.</text><text start="1198.5" dur="2.26">A Kickstarter brought it back in 2016,</text><text start="1200.76" dur="3.18">and then Netflix brought it back
for another couple of seasons.</text><text start="1203.94" dur="6.1">&lt;i&gt;Mystery Science Theater&lt;/i&gt; was absolutely criticism
and review and absolutely transformative.</text><text start="1210.04" dur="2.48">But they still licensed the movies.</text><text start="1212.52" dur="3.2">Anything that wasn&amp;#39;t in the public domain,
they negotiated and paid for,</text><text start="1215.72" dur="1.18">because… yeah.</text><text start="1216.9" dur="4.44">Playing out someone else&amp;#39;s entire movie,
just with wisecracks over it…</text><text start="1221.34" dur="1.44">probably not fair use.</text><text start="1222.78" dur="2.7">And even if it was, a studio would&amp;#39;ve
probably sued them at some point anyway,</text><text start="1225.48" dur="3.96">and they&amp;#39;d have had to defend the case
and spend the money to defend the case.</text><text start="1229.44" dur="4.38">Now, there have been YouTube commentary channels
who have defended lawsuits</text><text start="1233.82" dur="2.7">where fair use and fair dealing
seem clear.</text><text start="1236.52" dur="3.24">H3H3, an often-controversial
reaction and commentary channel,</text><text start="1239.76" dur="3.78">won a very expensive lawsuit that was
brought by someone they criticised.</text><text start="1243.54" dur="1.66">They were very happy about the result,</text><text start="1245.2" dur="1.54">and they shared that with their fans</text><text start="1246.74" dur="4.1">in a way that pretty much sums up
why their style…</text><text start="1250.84" dur="1.42">isn&amp;#39;t for everyone.</text><text start="1252.26" dur="2.22">&lt;font color=&quot;#00FFFF&quot;&gt;Good job, Hila.

that their video was transformative</text><text start="1261.98" dur="4.1">because it &amp;quot;responds to and
transforms the video from a skit</text><text start="1266.08" dur="4.58">&amp;quot;into fodder for caustic, moment-by-moment
commentary and mockery.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1270.66" dur="4.16">The judge&amp;#39;s decision goes into
the balancing factors of fair use in depth,</text><text start="1274.82" dur="4.14">but the most important bit
is a little bit further down:</text><text start="1278.96" dur="4.02">&amp;quot;Some reaction videos … intersperse
short segments of another&amp;#39;s work</text><text start="1282.98" dur="1.78">&amp;quot;with criticism and commentary,</text><text start="1284.76" dur="3.82">&amp;quot;while others are more akin to
a group viewing session without commentary.</text><text start="1288.58" dur="6.78">&amp;quot;Accordingly, the Court is not ruling here
that all &amp;#39;reaction videos&amp;#39; constitute fair use.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1295.36" dur="5.32">It&amp;#39;s clear that just playing a video and laughing at it
isn&amp;#39;t fair use. It&amp;#39;s copyright infringement.</text><text start="1300.68" dur="2.7">The border of fair use is
somewhere in the grey area</text><text start="1303.38" dur="5.08">between lazy zero-effort reaction streamers
and in-depth insightful criticism…</text><text start="1308.46" dur="2.64">but it&amp;#39;s a fuzzy border,
and right now, questions about it</text><text start="1311.1" dur="2.88">can only be settled on a case-by-case basis
in an expensive courtroom,</text><text start="1313.98" dur="3.56">because, yeah, there is one thread
throughout all these examples:</text><text start="1317.54" dur="3.94">under the current system, it often
doesn&amp;#39;t matter who&amp;#39;s actually in the right.</text><text start="1321.48" dur="2.52">Even if the answer to
&amp;quot;Is it fair use?&amp;quot; is clear,</text><text start="1324" dur="1.92">it&amp;#39;s actually about whether
you can afford to defend a case.</text><text start="1325.92" dur="3.7">You could be 100% sure it&amp;#39;s fair use…</text><text start="1329.62" dur="3.12">but unless you&amp;#39;re prepared to spend the time
and the money to actually fight that in court,</text><text start="1332.74" dur="2.86">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter.</text><text start="1335.6" dur="3.14">Which brings us to
how YouTube worked around this.</text><text start="1343.74" dur="4.18">Back in 2006, YouTube made an arrangement
with the big music companies,</text><text start="1347.92" dur="4.06">so the big industry players wouldn&amp;#39;t sue
this new platform out of existence.</text><text start="1351.98" dur="4.14">YouTube developed Content ID,
which scans every video uploaded</text><text start="1356.12" dur="3.96">and checks it against an enormous database
of copyrighted content.</text><text start="1360.08" dur="5.64">If there&amp;#39;s a match, everything works
completely outside the usual copyright system.</text><text start="1365.72" dur="4.22">All those worries about synchronisation licenses
and publication rights,</text><text start="1369.94" dur="3.5">all that law, is effectively replaced
with two contracts:</text><text start="1373.44" dur="2.8">one that&amp;#39;s private between YouTube
and the big media companies,</text><text start="1376.24" dur="2.62">and one that&amp;#39;s in the Terms of Service
that you agree to</text><text start="1378.86" dur="3.66">when you upload your bedroom-vlogger
video to YouTube.</text><text start="1382.52" dur="2.66">There is a public list of the music tracks
that are in Content ID,</text><text start="1385.18" dur="2.22">including the current policies
from the music companies.</text><text start="1387.4" dur="3.44">There&amp;#39;s no list of the TV shows,
or films, or other stuff that&amp;#39;s in there.</text><text start="1390.84" dur="3.3">Mostly, the copyright owners
just put adverts on the video.</text><text start="1394.14" dur="4.52">Sometimes, they do block it entirely, but…
those policies can change at any time,</text><text start="1398.66" dur="2.6">and if you do something
they particularly don&amp;#39;t like,</text><text start="1401.26" dur="1.9">it doesn&amp;#39;t make you immune
from lawsuits,</text><text start="1403.16" dur="3.96">or from formal takedown notices
under a law called the DMCA.</text><text start="1407.12" dur="2.68">They&amp;#39;re called &amp;quot;copyright strikes&amp;quot;
by YouTube.</text><text start="1409.8" dur="2.52">Those are still an option
for copyright owners.</text><text start="1412.32" dur="5.52">It&amp;#39;s just that with very, very few exceptions,
they&amp;#39;ll take the money from ads instead.</text><text start="1417.84" dur="2.4">Content ID means that video creators,</text><text start="1420.24" dur="3.86">unless they&amp;#39;re being so malicious
as to attract serious attention,</text><text start="1424.1" dur="2.78">generally don&amp;#39;t get sued
and don&amp;#39;t get DMCA takedowns.</text><text start="1426.88" dur="3.96">They don&amp;#39;t have to negotiate a
synchronisation license for cover songs.</text><text start="1430.84" dur="5.7">Now, some companies — music labels, mostly —
are also able to manually put Content ID claims</text><text start="1436.54" dur="2.88">on videos that
the automated systems miss.</text><text start="1439.42" dur="1.72">That is an avenue for abuse.</text><text start="1441.14" dur="2.74">And so is the manual appeals process
that&amp;#39;s meant to kick in</text><text start="1443.88" dur="3.66">if the automated systems have flagged
something that really is fair use,</text><text start="1447.54" dur="2.98">like a review, or a brief
incidental snippet of a song</text><text start="1450.52" dur="2.72">that was playing somewhere
as you walked by.</text><text start="1453.24" dur="2.92">Often, the appeals process does work…</text><text start="1456.16" dur="2.34">but give a corporation an inch,
and they&amp;#39;ll take a mile.</text><text start="1458.5" dur="3.64">Making decisions about fair use and copyright
is meant to be handed over</text><text start="1462.14" dur="4.08">to experienced, trained people
who can give nuanced judgements…</text><text start="1466.22" dur="1.9">but from the stories
that have come out over the years,</text><text start="1468.12" dur="3.56">it looks like it&amp;#39;s mostly subcontracted out
to the lowest bidder,</text><text start="1471.68" dur="4.58">with enormous decision-making power
given to people whose job is just to</text><text start="1476.26" dur="4.8">run through the backlog of appeals
as quickly as possible and make snap decisions,</text><text start="1481.06" dur="4.8">knowing that very few people will
actually be able to do anything about the result.</text><text start="1485.86" dur="2.36">I&amp;#39;ve been a victim of that in the past:</text><text start="1488.22" dur="2.86">A TV channel from Thailand
took one of my videos,</text><text start="1491.08" dur="2.56">played it out without permission
in one of their big television shows,</text><text start="1493.64" dur="3.26">and then put that entire television show
into Content ID.</text><text start="1496.9" dur="3.42">I got a Content ID hit
on my original video from them,</text><text start="1500.32" dur="2">and that took a long time
to sort out.</text><text start="1502.32" dur="1.3">And I never found out,
in the end,</text><text start="1503.62" dur="2.46">whether that channel kept their access
to Content ID or not,</text><text start="1506.08" dur="3.96">because, yes, companies that abuse it
should have it taken away from them.</text><text start="1510.04" dur="1.74">But, of course,
if YouTube does that,</text><text start="1511.78" dur="2.12">then they fall back
to the legal default position:</text><text start="1513.9" dur="1.84">DMCA takedowns or lawsuits,</text><text start="1515.74" dur="3.3">either against the creators
or against YouTube itself.</text><text start="1519.04" dur="4.26">There are absolutely flaws in Content ID.
I am not saying it&amp;#39;s perfect.</text><text start="1523.3" dur="2.2">There are hundreds of cases
that we could talk about</text><text start="1525.5" dur="1.84">where the system didn&amp;#39;t work,</text><text start="1527.34" dur="1.94">and thousands more
that never got enough publicity</text><text start="1529.28" dur="1.66">for the world to actually notice them.</text><text start="1530.94" dur="2.58">There are so many edge cases,</text><text start="1533.52" dur="3.9">like the people who got copyright claims
on white noise, just on the sound of static,</text><text start="1537.42" dur="3.14">because the system wasn&amp;#39;t originally built
to deal with white noise.</text><text start="1540.56" dur="3.26">Or the people who do in-depth
music theory analysis of songs,</text><text start="1543.82" dur="4.6">very likely fair use,
but still getting manual Content ID claims.</text><text start="1548.42" dur="2.54">But I don&amp;#39;t think Content ID is broken.</text><text start="1550.96" dur="2.98">It&amp;#39;s a reasonable stopgap.
It works almost all the time.</text><text start="1553.94" dur="3.8">That video of a couple&amp;#39;s first dance at a wedding,
uploaded by the father of the bride:</text><text start="1557.74" dur="3.32">No, copyright law doesn&amp;#39;t allow him
to upload that to YouTube,</text><text start="1561.06" dur="2.7">not unless he&amp;#39;s got
a synchronisation license.</text><text start="1563.76" dur="3">But Content ID just deals with it,
and the video stays up.</text><text start="1566.76" dur="3.28">That excited fan video
from the kid in the front row at a concert:</text><text start="1570.04" dur="2.16">No, not permitted under copyright law.</text><text start="1572.2" dur="1.66">Content ID deals with it.</text><text start="1573.86" dur="3.12">The teenager making a video
compiling all the romantic subtext</text><text start="1576.98" dur="2.14">between their two favourite characters
in a show:</text><text start="1579.12" dur="2.32">No, not allowed.
It&amp;#39;s not criticism or review.</text><text start="1581.44" dur="3.4">But Content ID deals with it,
and the video stays up.</text><text start="1584.84" dur="3.86">Without Content ID, those videos would be
taken down by DMCA copyright strikes,</text><text start="1588.7" dur="3.32">and if someone protested,
the next step is a lawsuit.</text><text start="1592.02" dur="1.56">Maybe for the uploader,
but more likely,</text><text start="1593.58" dur="2.24">the same would happen
as all those years ago:</text><text start="1595.82" dur="2.52">the big media companies
would go to YouTube and say:</text><text start="1598.34" dur="3.06">&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re allowing this to happen.
You&amp;#39;re making money off this.</text><text start="1601.4" dur="2.68">&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going to sue you
out of existence.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1604.08" dur="2.76">Sadly, it&amp;#39;s not about what&amp;#39;s fair,
or what&amp;#39;s just.</text><text start="1606.84" dur="4.72">It&amp;#39;s about the arrangement that YouTube
and the big media companies have come to.</text><text start="1611.56" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s not ideal,
but under copyright law,</text><text start="1613.96" dur="3.2">current copyright law at least,
I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a better option.</text><text start="1617.16" dur="2.5">And I don&amp;#39;t want to sound
like the grumpy old man</text><text start="1619.66" dur="1.52">complaining about the kids these days,</text><text start="1621.18" dur="4.54">but yes, when I started on YouTube, 2006,
there was no monetisation option.</text><text start="1625.72" dur="3.28">Creators could not earn money
on-platform at all.</text><text start="1629" dur="2.5">And that was fine, because it was a miracle
that someone was offering to do</text><text start="1631.5" dur="4.46">the incredibly expensive and difficult job
of hosting video for free!</text><text start="1635.96" dur="2.32">One of the reasons there aren&amp;#39;t
any serious competitors to YouTube</text><text start="1638.28" dur="3.52">is that it is ruinously expensive
to run a video hosting site:</text><text start="1641.8" dur="5.24">you either have to be a subscription service
or one of the world&amp;#39;s largest advertising firms.</text><text start="1647.04" dur="1.92">A lot of folks,
particularly younger people,</text><text start="1648.96" dur="3.46">who have only joined YouTube
in the last couple of years</text><text start="1652.42" dur="2.92">have a different baseline for this:</text><text start="1655.34" dur="3.94">They think that they have &amp;quot;the right&amp;quot; to upload
long compilations of their favourite videos</text><text start="1659.28" dur="2.26">with maybe a few words
spoken between each clip,</text><text start="1661.54" dur="1.52">and make loads of money from it,</text><text start="1663.06" dur="2.56">that that is something
that they are entitled to do,</text><text start="1665.62" dur="4.38">and that any copyright owners who complain
are censoring them and putting in false claims…</text><text start="1670" dur="4.12">Yeah. Okay, yes. I&amp;#39;m the grumpy old man
complaining about the kids.</text><text start="1674.12" dur="5.18">But, under the current copyright system,
those kids are legally in the wrong.</text><text start="1679.3" dur="1.72">Maybe not morally.
That&amp;#39;s a different question.</text><text start="1681.02" dur="2.94">But legally, they are in the wrong.</text><text start="1683.96" dur="2.28">There is an enormous distance</text><text start="1686.24" dur="3.36">between what the law says
and what the world&amp;#39;s actually doing,</text><text start="1689.6" dur="3.52">and that is where
most of this tension comes from.</text><text start="1693.12" dur="2.32">So. How do we fix it?</text><text start="1706.42" dur="1.4">We need three things.</text><text start="1707.82" dur="1.86">We need to update copyright law,</text><text start="1709.68" dur="2.76">we need a good small-claims court
for copyright,</text><text start="1712.44" dur="2.92">and we need to shorten
how long copyright lasts.</text><text start="1715.36" dur="2.86">So, first: updating the law.</text><text start="1718.22" dur="4.66">This is a big goal, but
the entirety of international copyright law</text><text start="1722.88" dur="3.46">needs to be rewritten
to reflect what&amp;#39;s fair in today&amp;#39;s world.</text><text start="1726.34" dur="2.66">Everyone will have a different opinion
of what that is.</text><text start="1729" dur="1.9">I&amp;#39;m actually fairly conservative on it.</text><text start="1730.9" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m not convinced that we should
massively widen the definition of fair use,</text><text start="1734.38" dur="3.12">because every bit of freedom
you give to individual creators</text><text start="1737.5" dur="3">also makes it easier for big companies
to rip them off.</text><text start="1740.5" dur="2.58">But I&amp;#39;m not going to say
where the line should be drawn.</text><text start="1743.08" dur="3.02">It is a job for consultation
and conversation,</text><text start="1746.1" dur="3.96">where everyone is at the table,
not just the big publishers.</text><text start="1750.06" dur="5.12">And if completely rewriting
international law seems unlikely,</text><text start="1755.18" dur="2.36">then it&amp;#39;s still possible
to push for changes.</text><text start="1757.54" dur="4.98">In 1990, one article by one judge
swayed opinion among the US legal community,</text><text start="1762.52" dur="2.64">and helped change
the most important factor of fair use</text><text start="1765.16" dur="3.12">from whether it was commercial
to whether it was transformative.</text><text start="1768.28" dur="3.68">It is entirely possible that
new publications like that</text><text start="1771.96" dur="1.62">could help improve things.</text><text start="1773.58" dur="3.54">The judge&amp;#39;s conclusion in that article
also makes an excellent point:</text><text start="1777.12" dur="4.16">there should not be a clear
and unambiguous definition of &amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot;,</text><text start="1781.28" dur="4.58">what he calls a &amp;quot;bright line standard&amp;quot;,
unless we have a good standard.</text><text start="1785.86" dur="1.06">And we don&amp;#39;t have one.</text><text start="1786.92" dur="4.72">The border of fair use has to be messy
because people and creativity are messy.</text><text start="1792.58" dur="4.14">So if fair use is going to be messy,
and if it will inevitably lead to conflict,</text><text start="1796.72" dur="3.46">let&amp;#39;s make resolving that conflict
quick, fair and accessible.</text><text start="1800.18" dur="3.84">This is already starting to happen
in the United States, but badly.</text><text start="1804.02" dur="3.64">The UK has one of the world&amp;#39;s friendliest
copyright regimes for individual creators.</text><text start="1807.66" dur="3.06">We have the
Intellectual Property Enterprise Court,</text><text start="1810.72" dur="3.4">which is mainly based here,
at the Royal Courts of Justice in London,</text><text start="1814.12" dur="2.34">and it&amp;#39;s a specific court
to deal with cases</text><text start="1816.46" dur="2.56">about copyrights, and patents,
and trademarks.</text><text start="1819.02" dur="2.82">And that court has a small claims track.</text><text start="1821.84" dur="2.12">If you&amp;#39;re an individual photographer
or video maker,</text><text start="1823.96" dur="2.9">you can do the research,
file the right forms, follow the right procedures,</text><text start="1826.86" dur="3.04">and issue a claim
as a &amp;quot;litigant in person&amp;quot;,</text><text start="1829.9" dur="2.86">which is the fancy British term for
&amp;quot;without a lawyer&amp;quot;.</text><text start="1832.76" dur="2.92">I&amp;#39;ve done it, because a major company
ripped off one of my videos.</text><text start="1835.68" dur="2.44">This court is designed to be
more friendly for individuals:</text><text start="1838.12" dur="4.1">the procedures are more relaxed,
it&amp;#39;s almost like mediation rather than a court…</text><text start="1842.22" dur="1.94">except that,
if all negotiations fail,</text><text start="1844.16" dur="3.16">then there is a judge
issuing a legal order at the end of it.</text><text start="1847.32" dur="2.24">It is stressful. It is hard work.
You need to get all the details right.</text><text start="1849.56" dur="1.68">You should probably get a lawyer
if you&amp;#39;re gonna do it,</text><text start="1851.24" dur="4.24">but if your job is basically
reading hundreds of pages of nerdy detail</text><text start="1855.48" dur="2.02">and summarising it into something
the world can understand,</text><text start="1857.5" dur="2.76">then, yeah, it can be done.</text><text start="1860.26" dur="2.26">It is really nerve-wracking.</text><text start="1862.52" dur="2.6">Like, most of the people
who walk into the admin building</text><text start="1865.12" dur="2.5">of one of the biggest courts in the country,
without a lawyer,</text><text start="1867.62" dur="1.9">to try and file a claim…</text><text start="1869.52" dur="3.32">They don&amp;#39;t have the best grip on reality,
but all of them think they do.</text><text start="1872.84" dur="2.66">And there I was,
walking in, no lawyer,</text><text start="1875.5" dur="2.26">thinking I had a case,
thinking I had a grip on reality.</text><text start="1877.76" dur="3.82">Statistically, the odds weren&amp;#39;t in my favour,
but I filed successfully.</text><text start="1881.58" dur="2.94">And the company settled with me,
they paid me to drop the claim,</text><text start="1884.52" dur="3.1">because they were in the wrong,
and they knew they were in the wrong,</text><text start="1887.62" dur="2.96">and they knew I could actually get it to a judge
in exchange for a bit of work</text><text start="1890.58" dur="2.72">and a court fee of just over £100.</text><text start="1893.3" dur="2.68">There is a plan to do something like that
in the United States.</text><text start="1895.98" dur="4.16">At the time of recording, the Copyright Alternative
In Small Claims Enforcement Act,</text><text start="1900.14" dur="2.68">the CASE Act,
is passing through government.</text><text start="1902.82" dur="2.04">Unfortunately, it has massive flaws:</text><text start="1904.86" dur="2.98">using the new small-claims track
is voluntary for both parties,</text><text start="1907.84" dur="2.7">which means that
if you want to sue a big company,</text><text start="1910.54" dur="2.14">that company can just choose
to opt-out</text><text start="1912.68" dur="2.46">and require you to
take the expensive path.</text><text start="1915.14" dur="1.38">And to quote an explainer:</text><text start="1916.52" dur="3.22">&amp;quot;If the losing party does not comply
with the judgment,</text><text start="1919.74" dur="3.64">&amp;quot;the prevailing party can bring an action
in federal court to enforce it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1923.38" dur="2.88">So if you actually want the judgment
to be effective,</text><text start="1926.26" dur="2.68">you may have to take
the expensive path anyway.</text><text start="1928.94" dur="4.68">In short, all the power is still with
the people who have money.</text><text start="1933.62" dur="3.36">Oh, and it means that it&amp;#39;s now much,
much cheaper for big companies</text><text start="1936.98" dur="3.48">to try and enforce unfair claims
against large numbers of individuals:</text><text start="1940.46" dur="2.7">it&amp;#39;s a so-called &amp;#39;default judgment mill&amp;#39;.</text><text start="1943.16" dur="1.9">The CASE Act is not a fix.</text><text start="1945.06" dur="2.44">It&amp;#39;s a step
sort-of in the right direction,</text><text start="1947.5" dur="2.7">but it&amp;#39;s not great,
and it may well lead to more problems.</text><text start="1950.2" dur="2.92">There&amp;#39;s also a wider problem
dealing with this across international borders,</text><text start="1953.12" dur="1.88">but that&amp;#39;s a separate issue.</text><text start="1955" dur="3.74">Having a working small-claims process
in the United States</text><text start="1958.74" dur="3.56">would help address the massive imbalance
between the rights of individuals</text><text start="1962.3" dur="1.92">and the rights of huge corporations,</text><text start="1964.22" dur="2.1">at least on this platform,
on YouTube.</text><text start="1966.32" dur="4.88">And even if that&amp;#39;s just in the US:
from there, the world will follow.</text><text start="1971.2" dur="4.12">So then finally:
we shorten how long copyright lasts.</text><text start="1975.76" dur="3.62">Under current US law,
if a modern work has an individual author,</text><text start="1979.38" dur="4.46">then its copyright generally lasts
until death plus 70 years.</text><text start="1983.84" dur="3.26">For works by a corporation,
it&amp;#39;s 95 years from publication.</text><text start="1987.1" dur="2.32">There are a huge number of
complicated factors for older works</text><text start="1989.42" dur="2.8">because of the many, many changes
to the law over the decades,</text><text start="1992.22" dur="2.34">but that&amp;#39;s a decent rule of thumb.</text><text start="1994.56" dur="2.86">And… that&amp;#39;s too long.</text><text start="1997.42" dur="2.34">Singer-songwriter turned politician
Sonny Bono,</text><text start="1999.76" dur="4.88">the person who the Copyright Term
Extension Act of 1998 was named after:</text><text start="2004.64" dur="2.12">He believed that copyright should be forever.</text><text start="2006.76" dur="1.62">That the great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-</text><text start="2008.38" dur="2.56">great-great-great-great-
great-grandchildren of Shakespeare</text><text start="2010.94" dur="3.3">should still be able to charge licensing fees
for adapting Shakespeare&amp;#39;s work —</text><text start="2014.24" dur="3.28">or more likely, those rights would&amp;#39;ve been sold
to a corporation at some point,</text><text start="2017.52" dur="3.3">and &amp;quot;Shakespeare Intellectual Property Ltd.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2020.82" dur="3.64">would now be able to collect
license fees into eternity.</text><text start="2024.46" dur="5.46">I think that opinion is so ridiculous
as to be indefensible.</text><text start="2029.92" dur="2.58">If copyright lasted forever,
if nothing ever entered the public domain,</text><text start="2032.5" dur="2.2">then yeah, someone
would still have the final say</text><text start="2034.7" dur="3.16">on how Shakespeare
could be adapted or performed.</text><text start="2037.86" dur="1.92">Perhaps you could perform it
however you wanted,</text><text start="2039.78" dur="2.08">but only by paying
an enormous license fee.</text><text start="2041.86" dur="3.4">Little community theatres like this?
Priced out.</text><text start="2045.26" dur="2.92">Or perhaps someone would want to defend
the Shakespeare Brand Guidelines,</text><text start="2048.18" dur="3.92">and insist that all adaptations
be entirely faithful to the original text.</text><text start="2052.1" dur="2.86">So, no Baz Luhrmann &lt;i&gt;Romeo + Juliet &lt;/i&gt;
without permission.</text><text start="2054.96" dur="2.58">No &lt;i&gt;10 Things I Hate About You &lt;/i&gt;
without permission.</text><text start="2057.54" dur="2">&lt;i&gt;The Lion King&lt;/i&gt;?</text><text start="2059.54" dur="3.12">Very close to &lt;i&gt;Hamlet&lt;/i&gt;, that.
You want to avoid that lawsuit.</text><text start="2062.66" dur="3.02">Making a reference to how
&amp;quot;all the world&amp;#39;s a stage&amp;quot;?</text><text start="2065.68" dur="1.68">Pay up. Needs a license.</text><text start="2067.36" dur="1.58">And if you think that&amp;#39;s ridiculous,</text><text start="2068.94" dur="2.96">find any book that quotes
one copyrighted song lyric,</text><text start="2071.9" dur="1.52">maybe to introduce a chapter:</text><text start="2073.42" dur="2.66">there will be an acknowledgement
somewhere</text><text start="2076.08" dur="2.66">that they&amp;#39;ve got permission
from the copyright holder.</text><text start="2078.74" dur="3.94">The point of copyright is to allow people
to profit from their creative work.</text><text start="2082.68" dur="3.72">I am not against copyright.
I rely on copyright to earn a living.</text><text start="2086.4" dur="4.52">But the works that fall into the public domain
are vital for creativity.</text><text start="2090.92" dur="2.24">And patents only last twenty years!</text><text start="2093.16" dur="1.5">Twenty years before your patent expires,</text><text start="2094.66" dur="2.4">and anyone can take your actual,
physical, real-world invention</text><text start="2097.06" dur="2.14">and just churn out cheap copies for everyone.</text><text start="2099.2" dur="3.28">If you invent something that literally
changes the world, great!</text><text start="2102.48" dur="2.86">You get twenty years
to make all the money you can,</text><text start="2105.34" dur="2.24">and after that, you will be out-competed</text><text start="2107.58" dur="2.38">by other people who can do it
better and cheaper.</text><text start="2109.96" dur="3.28">But write a song?
You get until you&amp;#39;re dead!</text><text start="2113.24" dur="2.98">Plus your descendants get
another seventy years.</text><text start="2116.22" dur="1.74">That is ridiculous!</text><text start="2117.96" dur="2.34">And meanwhile,
all the &amp;quot;orphaned works&amp;quot;,</text><text start="2120.3" dur="2.6">the obscure things where no-one can
track down the copyright holder anymore</text><text start="2122.9" dur="1.56">to ask for a license…</text><text start="2124.46" dur="2.14">Well, they can&amp;#39;t be archived,
they can&amp;#39;t be copied.</text><text start="2126.6" dur="1.96">They often can&amp;#39;t be preserved at all,</text><text start="2128.56" dur="2.84">just because no-one knows
who to ask for permission.</text><text start="2131.4" dur="3.04">The longer copyright is,
the worse that problem gets.</text><text start="2134.44" dur="3.02">And I know, a twenty-year copyright term
that matches patents</text><text start="2137.46" dur="1.94">would never get through modern politics.</text><text start="2139.4" dur="1.72">When you have enormous corporations</text><text start="2141.12" dur="3.14">that earn billions from
their copyrighted back catalogue,</text><text start="2144.26" dur="3.14">it is trivial for them to spend
a fraction of that</text><text start="2147.4" dur="2.8">on lobbying to make sure
copyright doesn&amp;#39;t get reduced.</text><text start="2150.2" dur="3.76">I would like it to be twenty years,
I would campaign for twenty years,</text><text start="2153.96" dur="2.64">but… I also know
that it&amp;#39;s not going to happen.</text><text start="2156.6" dur="1.74">And, to be fair, it does feel like</text><text start="2158.34" dur="1.94">the people who made the songs
of the &amp;#39;80s and &amp;#39;90s,</text><text start="2160.28" dur="4.44">the songs that are still being listened to
in this current nostalgia cycle,</text><text start="2164.72" dur="2.2">they should probably be able to make
some money from that.</text><text start="2166.92" dur="3.16">So, I would suggest 50 years.</text><text start="2170.08" dur="2.76">It&amp;#39;s an easy number, it allows
a couple of nostalgia cycles to happen,</text><text start="2172.84" dur="4.44">and it would mean that right now,
the &amp;#39;60s would be public domain,</text><text start="2177.28" dur="1.9">and the &amp;#39;70s would be on their way.</text><text start="2179.18" dur="4.86">The decades that are no longer
pop-culture nostalgia, but history.</text><text start="2184.04" dur="3.86">Pachelbel, Chopin, Beethoven: they should
already be joined in the public domain</text><text start="2187.9" dur="2.64">by Dylan and Mitchell
and Hendrix and Cline.</text><text start="2190.54" dur="2.7">Shakespeare and Shelley —
either Shelley —</text><text start="2193.24" dur="3.76">they should be joined by Lee and Heller
and Orwell and countless others,</text><text start="2197" dur="2.38">including the works that
no-one can trace the owner of,</text><text start="2199.38" dur="4.06">because after 50 years, you shouldn&amp;#39;t
need to trace the owner of a work.</text><text start="2203.44" dur="2.88">You should just be able to use it.</text><text start="2206.32" dur="3.2">Anyone should be able to make
a &lt;i&gt;James Bond&lt;/i&gt; movie by now.</text><text start="2209.52" dur="2.1">&amp;#39;Cause they&amp;#39;d probably do a better job.</text><text start="2211.62" dur="4.42">Yes, the people who have already made
ludicrous amounts of money</text><text start="2216.04" dur="3.62">would not be able to make
as much anymore, sure.</text><text start="2219.66" dur="3.3">But the artists&amp;#39; work, the thing they&amp;#39;re
supposed to actually care about,</text><text start="2222.96" dur="2.6">could be enjoyed and built on by everyone.</text><text start="2225.56" dur="2.62">And the few artists from back then
who are still popular</text><text start="2228.18" dur="1.54">will be absolutely fine,</text><text start="2229.72" dur="2.92">continuing to make money from
their world tours, and merchandise,</text><text start="2232.64" dur="2.52">and public appearances, and newer albums.</text><text start="2235.16" dur="4.84">And an entire new generation
would get exposed to music and writing and art</text><text start="2240" dur="2.62">that might otherwise be forgotten about.</text><text start="2242.62" dur="4.62">A shorter copyright term would badly affect
perhaps a few hundred people in the world:</text><text start="2247.24" dur="3.36">the folks who created one hit song,
or one incredible book</text><text start="2250.6" dur="2.34">that is still bringing them money
decades later,</text><text start="2252.94" dur="3.4">and who are now relying on that money
as their only source of income.</text><text start="2256.34" dur="5.76">It&amp;#39;s not many people, but yes, the very,
very, very few who fit into that category,</text><text start="2262.1" dur="1.32">it&amp;#39;ll suck for them.</text><text start="2263.42" dur="2.94">If royalties were their pension scheme —
I mean, that&amp;#39;s bad financial planning,</text><text start="2266.36" dur="3.02">but if they were thinking that
the one song they made in &amp;#39;64</text><text start="2269.38" dur="2.38">will get them through their retirement,</text><text start="2271.76" dur="1.9">yeah, it&amp;#39;s gonna be a shock.</text><text start="2273.66" dur="2.52">I do not believe that
that&amp;#39;s a strong enough argument</text><text start="2276.18" dur="2.76">to justify locking up
all that creativity,</text><text start="2278.94" dur="3.6">all that potential for the entire world,
for that long.</text><text start="2282.54" dur="1.34">No-one&amp;#39;s going to stop creating</text><text start="2283.88" dur="2.38">because they only get 50 years&amp;#39;
or 20 years&amp;#39; copyright.</text><text start="2286.26" dur="3.1">Songwriters, and authors, and filmmakers,
and choreographers, and YouTube creators:</text><text start="2289.36" dur="2.44">we make things because we can.</text><text start="2291.8" dur="2.54">Because we have ideas
and we want to show them to the world.</text><text start="2294.34" dur="4.16">Not because we&amp;#39;re thinking that
our grandchildren might, one day,</text><text start="2298.5" dur="4.3">have a chance of getting a trickle of money
from some future copyright license.</text><text start="2302.8" dur="5">So, when I say that YouTube&amp;#39;s
copyright system isn&amp;#39;t broken, I mean it.</text><text start="2307.8" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s a reasonable patch,
a bit of duct tape</text><text start="2310.8" dur="2.98">holding together a system
that&amp;#39;s somehow still just about working,</text><text start="2313.78" dur="3.24">despite being completely unsuited
for the modern world.</text><text start="2317.02" dur="1.6">Yes, occasionally it goes wrong.</text><text start="2318.62" dur="3.08">When that happens, it should be fixed
quickly and transparently.</text><text start="2321.7" dur="3.4">But the long-term solution
is not to apply another patch,</text><text start="2325.1" dur="2.1">on another patch, on another patch,
on another patch.</text><text start="2327.2" dur="3.94">The solution is to fix the system
that it&amp;#39;s trying to work around.</text><text start="2331.14" dur="1.66">Because that&amp;#39;s the problem.</text><text start="2332.8" dur="2.86">YouTube&amp;#39;s copyright system isn&amp;#39;t broken.</text><text start="2335.66" dur="1.8">The world&amp;#39;s is.</text><text start="2337.46" dur="1.92">Alright, that&amp;#39;s it.
