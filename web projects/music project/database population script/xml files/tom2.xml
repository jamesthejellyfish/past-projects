Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire.</text><text start="9.46" dur="4.12">And I reckon it is the most dangerous stretch
of water anywhere on Earth.</text><text start="13.58" dur="2.719">Now that&amp;#39;s a bold claim, I know.</text><text start="16.299" dur="2.851">There are certainly rivers that have taken
more lives,</text><text start="19.15" dur="3.1">and there are rapids and waterfalls that few
boats could ever sail.</text><text start="22.25" dur="2.8">But generally, you can see them coming.</text><text start="25.05" dur="2.479">This is just an innocent looking stream in
the middle of some woods.</text><text start="27.529" dur="2.42">You could jump over it. People occasionally
do.</text><text start="29.949" dur="3.601">But if you miss that jump, it&amp;#39;ll kill you.</text><text start="33.55" dur="3.09">This is what the river looks like about a
hundred metres upstream.</text><text start="36.64" dur="1.82">Same river. All that water went down.</text><text start="38.46" dur="5.009">Thanks to the local geology, the river basically
turns on its side,</text><text start="43.469" dur="3.381">gouging out passages and tunnels in the rocks
below.</text><text start="46.85" dur="1.67">Those banks are actually overhangs:</text><text start="48.52" dur="2.559">there isn&amp;#39;t any riverbed just below the surface,</text><text start="51.079" dur="6.25">it&amp;#39;s a deep, boiling mass of fast and deadly
currents.</text><text start="57.329" dur="3.901">There are claims that falling in has a 100%
fatality rate.</text><text start="61.23" dur="1.91">There&amp;#39;s no way to confirm that, of course,</text><text start="63.14" dur="3.84">because &amp;quot;local person doesn&amp;#39;t die in river&amp;quot;
doesn&amp;#39;t make the news,</text><text start="66.98" dur="2.52">but it has claimed a lot of lives:</text><text start="69.5" dur="3.4">there are even tales from the 12th century
of a young boy,</text><text start="72.9" dur="2.13">set to be the future king of Scotland,</text><text start="75.03" dur="3.26">who died trying to jump across those waters.</text><text start="78.29" dur="1.91">And anything, or anyone, that falls in</text><text start="80.2" dur="2.68">might not come out in any recognisable form:</text><text start="82.88" dur="3.29">it could just get pulverised against the rocks
underwater</text><text start="86.17" dur="3.44">over and over and over again.</text><text start="89.61" dur="1.56">I&amp;#39;d try and put a camera in,</text><text start="91.17" dur="2.33">but then I&amp;#39;d have to get close to the edge.</text><text start="93.5" dur="3.49">And the edge isn&amp;#39;t sharp, it just curves towards
the water</text><text start="96.99" dur="2.5">and it&amp;#39;s covered in slippery moss.</text><text start="99.49" dur="3.5">Besides, the water is opaque and brown with
peat stain,</text><text start="102.99" dur="1.87">you&amp;#39;d see nothing.</text><text start="104.86" dur="4.76">Is it survivable? Maybe, with a lot of equipment
and a lot of luck.</text><text start="109.62" dur="3.34">And you&amp;#39;ll find occasional testimony from
foolhardy people</text><text start="112.96" dur="3.13">who&amp;#39;ve swum in the calmer pools at the bottom
on drier days --</text><text start="116.09" dur="4.78">but that&amp;#39;s also where a young child drowned
back in 2010.</text><text start="120.87" dur="1.34">That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so dangerous.</text><text start="122.21" dur="2.88">It looks safe, it looks tempting,</text><text start="125.09" dur="1.48">and it&amp;#39;ll kill you.</text><text start="127.96" dur="2">[Translating these subtitles?
