<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.18" dur="2.14">Welcome to Foulness Island.</text><text start="2.32" dur="1.55">The name is unfortunate.</text><text start="3.87" dur="1.5">It either meant &amp;#39;muddy headland&amp;#39;</text><text start="5.37" dur="2.47">or possibly &amp;#39;bird headland&amp;#39;
a few centuries ago.</text><text start="7.84" dur="1.18">It&amp;#39;s about nine square miles,</text><text start="9.02" dur="1.55">there&amp;#39;s around 150 people who live on it.</text><text start="10.57" dur="3.52">But unless you are one of those people
or you&amp;#39;ve got business with them,</text><text start="14.09" dur="1.44">you will not be allowed in.</text><text start="15.53" dur="1.76">Most of the island and, importantly,</text><text start="17.29" dur="2.28">the road and bridge that get you onto it:</text><text start="19.57" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re owned by the British military
and they will turn you away.</text><text start="22.69" dur="2.27">But despite having no business here,</text><text start="24.96" dur="2.18">I am on the island, legally.</text><text start="27.14" dur="2.68">And that&amp;#39;s because I didn&amp;#39;t
use the road and bridge.</text><text start="29.82" dur="3.08">I walked along a very
different path to get here.</text><text start="32.9" dur="1.43">The Broomway has been called</text><text start="34.33" dur="2.64">the most dangerous, most
deadly path in Britain.</text><text start="36.97" dur="1.94">It goes back at least 600 years.</text><text start="38.91" dur="1.75">And the only reason that
I walked here safely</text><text start="40.66" dur="2.18">is because I had a guide.</text><text start="42.84" dur="3.64">A few miles back before we set off,
I asked him a few questions.</text><text start="46.48" dur="5.03">- Historically, there is reportedly
60-100 casualties on the Broomway.</text><text start="51.51" dur="3.88">The main thing is the tide.
It whips round from the North Sea</text><text start="55.39" dur="4.96">and would come from, not as you expect,
straight on from the horizon,</text><text start="60.35" dur="4.85">but it&amp;#39;ll often spiral in to the coastline,
and so it&amp;#39;ll cut you off from your pathway.</text><text start="65.2" dur="2.04">It&amp;#39;s very easy to get
lost out on the Broomway,</text><text start="67.24" dur="4.3">particularly in low-visibility
conditions when it&amp;#39;s raining</text><text start="71.54" dur="2.55">or there&amp;#39;s low fog,
early morning, late at night.</text><text start="74.09" dur="3.15">As there&amp;#39;s no features or markers
to take your bearing from,</text><text start="77.24" dur="2.36">you can get very quickly disorientated.</text><text start="79.6" dur="2.89">Quite often, people will
naturally walk further out to sea,</text><text start="82.49" dur="1.87">as opposed to back to land.</text><text start="84.36" dur="3.14">The Broomway&amp;#39;s only open at
the weekends for the public.</text><text start="87.5" dur="3.04">The MOD use this as an
active firing range,</text><text start="90.54" dur="2.47">and they have done since the late 1800s.</text><text start="93.01" dur="3.62">And so, one thing that we might
see out there is leftover ordnance.</text><text start="96.63" dur="3.03">They do a pretty good job of
cleaning up after themselves,</text><text start="99.66" dur="2.31">but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that
we won&amp;#39;t see any out there.</text><text start="101.97" dur="2.18">I&amp;#39;ve seen shells this big.</text><text start="104.15" dur="1.79">You just have to really
keep your distance.</text><text start="105.94" dur="1.81">Shell craters are also a problem</text><text start="107.75" dur="2.57">because of the exploded ordnance
that has gone off,</text><text start="110.32" dur="1.65">so it&amp;#39;s essentially quick sand.</text><text start="111.97" dur="3.21">And so, there&amp;#39;ll be pockets of sand
which are really soft and mushy</text><text start="115.18" dur="3.12">that your feet will sink into
that we have to be careful of.</text><text start="118.3" dur="3.27">I only guide walks when the
tide is constantly going out.</text><text start="121.57" dur="3.26">So, we are three hours after high tide.</text><text start="124.83" dur="1.91">The tide is still on its way out,</text><text start="126.74" dur="3.13">and we should be coming back
here as the tides are turning.</text><text start="129.87" dur="2.31">- So, obviously, we made it.
Thank you, Tom!</text><text start="132.18" dur="1.42">The path&amp;#39;s called the Broomway</text><text start="133.6" dur="2.07">because back before the
military built that bridge,</text><text start="135.67" dur="2.39">back when it was the only
access onto this island,</text><text start="138.06" dur="3.37">it was marked by &amp;quot;brooms&amp;quot;
every 30 metres or so.</text><text start="141.43" dur="1.37">Now, to 21st-century people,</text><text start="142.8" dur="2.36">that implies broom handles
sticking out the ground.</text><text start="145.16" dur="2.48">But, no, I tracked down a photo from 1922,</text><text start="147.64" dur="3.49">and the brooms were just
short lumps of brush.</text><text start="151.13" dur="3.24">But over the last century,
those brooms stopped being maintained.</text><text start="154.37" dur="1.95">They were either swept away or eroded,</text><text start="156.32" dur="4.45">and now the path is unmarked.
But it&amp;#39;s still on the map.</text><text start="160.77" dur="1.69">It&amp;#39;s still a legal path.</text><text start="162.46" dur="3.7">Permanently closing a right-of-way
in Britain is difficult.</text><text start="166.16" dur="4.1">- On Foulness, there are public right-of-way
footpaths that we can access.</text><text start="170.26" dur="4.6">They are rarely used.
And so, if you do take them,</text><text start="174.86" dur="2.06">the security switchboards will light up</text><text start="176.92" dur="4.89">because you&amp;#39;ll get reported by MOD staff
or by locals who live there</text><text start="181.81" dur="1.65">because they think you&amp;#39;re trespassing.</text><text start="183.46" dur="3.33">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be guiding this if I wasn&amp;#39;t
a qualified mountain leader</text><text start="186.79" dur="2.66">who has map and compass skills,</text><text start="189.45" dur="2.91">good experience of this
guided walk that I do.</text><text start="192.36" dur="4.85">I have first aid qualifications,
so I know how to deal with</text><text start="197.21" dur="3.29">and treat the likely emergencies
that could happen out here.</text><text start="200.5" dur="1.71">- That article from 1922</text><text start="202.21" dur="2.54">also named some of the
people who died on the path.</text><text start="204.75" dur="2.25">Several doctors travelling
to attend patients,</text><text start="207" dur="4.15">young women trying to reach partners,
and island residents who got careless,</text><text start="211.15" dur="3">or who would sometimes stay
in the mainland pubs too late</text><text start="214.15" dur="3.26">and then try to race the tide
back on a galloping horse.</text><text start="217.41" dur="3.29">Because the part of the Broomway we walked
isn&amp;#39;t just a footpath.</text><text start="220.7" dur="3.4">Under modern law, it is a
&amp;quot;byway open to all traffic&amp;quot;,</text><text start="224.1" dur="2.83">which means that, in theory,
you can take a horse</text><text start="226.93" dur="3.17">or a tractor or anything
that&amp;#39;s road legal onto it.</text><text start="230.1" dur="3.48">It would be a very, very bad idea
to just drive onto the sands,</text><text start="233.58" dur="3.733">but in theory you could,
if you didn&amp;#39;t get bogged down.</text><text start="238.25" dur="2.74">Now, a few times a year,
the village on the island</text><text start="240.99" dur="1.88">and the main road are open for tourism,</text><text start="242.87" dur="2.15">but not right now, not in 2020,</text><text start="245.02" dur="2.82">which means that right
now there is only one way</text><text start="247.84" dur="2.55">for the average person to
get onto Foulness Island.</text><text start="251.23" dur="1.91">But there are two ways to leave.</text><text start="253.14" dur="4.06">We could go off the rights of way,
trespass onto military land,</text><text start="257.2" dur="2.69">and then very soon after get
escorted off by soldiers,</text><text start="259.89" dur="1.606">assuming we weren&amp;#39;t arrested.</text><text start="261.496" dur="3.055">Or... we can just walk back.</text><text start="265.25" dur="2.08">Ready when you are!
- Let&amp;#39;s go!</text><text start="267.33" dur="1.3">- Thank you very much to Tom Bennett!</text><text start="268.63" dur="2.87">He&amp;#39;s a qualified mountain leader
who runs tours across Britain.</text><text start="271.5" dur="1.92">I&amp;#39;ll put a link to his website
in the description.</text><text start="273.42" dur="2.11">It feels really weird talking about you</text><text start="275.53" dur="1.617">in the third person
when you&amp;#39;re just there.</text><text start="277.147" dur="1.518">[both laughing]
- Yeah.</text><text start="278.665" dur="1.461">[water sloshing]</text><text start="280.126" dur="0.833">- Ugh!</text></transcript>
