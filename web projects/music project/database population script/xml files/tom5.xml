Not properly.</text><text start="2.6" dur="1.819">This camera can&amp;#39;t capture it,</text><text start="4.419" dur="1.221">YouTube can&amp;#39;t store it,</text><text start="5.64" dur="2.119">and your screen can&amp;#39;t display it.</text><text start="7.759" dur="2.401">I&amp;#39;m in the studio of artist Stuart Semple,</text><text start="10.16" dur="4.16">and he&amp;#39;s made what he calls the Pinkest Pink.</text><text start="14.32" dur="2.529">I&amp;#39;ve been painting since
I was five years old,</text><text start="16.849" dur="2.201">and I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of pink.</text><text start="19.05" dur="2.77">And thousands and thousands of people
have used the pink,</text><text start="21.82" dur="2.86">and nobody&amp;#39;s said they&amp;#39;ve seen a pinker pink.</text><text start="24.689" dur="1.35">This stuff&amp;#39;s really pink.</text><text start="26.039" dur="3.56">I&amp;#39;ve created the pinkest pink,
the greenest green,</text><text start="29.599" dur="2.781">the loveliest blue,
and the yellowest yellow.</text><text start="32.38" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;ve also created the world&amp;#39;s most glittery
natural glitter</text><text start="35.89" dur="4.239">and the mattest blackest
art material in the world.</text><text start="40.129" dur="4.27">About a year and a half ago, a company called
Surrey Nanosystems</text><text start="44.399" dur="2.581">announced that they&amp;#39;d created Vantablack,</text><text start="46.98" dur="4.19">which was this really awesome
blacker-than-the-blackest-black black</text><text start="51.17" dur="3.55">but they gave the exclusive rights to an artist
called Anish Kapoor to use it,</text><text start="54.72" dur="2.049">and that annoyed a lot of artists,</text><text start="56.769" dur="1.711">and I got really annoyed as well.</text><text start="58.48" dur="2.21">So I put my Pinkest Pink out.</text><text start="60.69" dur="2.189">On the web site I put a disclaimer</text><text start="62.88" dur="2.9">that you weren&amp;#39;t Anish Kapoor,
you weren&amp;#39;t associated with Anish Kapoor.</text><text start="65.78" dur="2.54">A lot of people thought that was quite funny</text><text start="68.329" dur="2.441">and a lot of people bought the pink</text><text start="70.77" dur="3.9">unfortunately including Anish Kapoor,
who managed to get his hands on it</text><text start="74.67" dur="1.62">and then he dipped his finger in it</text><text start="76.29" dur="2.96">and put it on Instagram
that he&amp;#39;d got the pink.</text><text start="79.25" dur="3.06">It was sort of great and sort of really frustrating
when he did that,</text><text start="82.31" dur="2.93">because all of a sudden we were getting
thousands and thousands of orders</text><text start="85.24" dur="4.03">we ended up staying up for about four weeks
making pink paint</text><text start="89.27" dur="1.129">and nothing else could happen</text><text start="90.399" dur="1.861">and it just took over our whole life.</text><text start="92.26" dur="4.13">There are all sorts of complicated and clever
ways that computers can store colour,</text><text start="96.39" dur="2.17">but by the time this video reaches your screen</text><text start="98.56" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s basically just a series of numbers that
say how bright</text><text start="102.04" dur="2.789">to make each of the red, green and blue pixels,</text><text start="104.829" dur="3.051">the tiny lights that make up your screen.</text><text start="107.88" dur="2.96">And unless you&amp;#39;ve got
a really fancy, expensive screen,</text><text start="110.84" dur="5.069">those numbers run from 0 to 255 --
which is eight 1s in binary.</text><text start="115.909" dur="5.13">0 means turn the pixel off,
255 means as bright as it can go.</text><text start="121.039" dur="4.911">That means your screen can show
somewhere around 16 million colours.</text><text start="125.95" dur="1.279">But that&amp;#39;s not every colour.</text><text start="127.229" dur="1.64">And it&amp;#39;s not this one.</text><text start="128.869" dur="3.471">Because if I pointed this camera at the sun,
you wouldn&amp;#39;t be blinded.</text><text start="132.34" dur="5.09">The numbers can&amp;#39;t go above 255, I can&amp;#39;t make
your screen go brighter than 100%.</text><text start="137.43" dur="5.37">And if I point it at something extremely dark,
the number can&amp;#39;t go below 0.</text><text start="142.8" dur="3.76">I can&amp;#39;t make your screen any darker
than if it was turned off.</text><text start="146.56" dur="2.87">In the same way, there are colours that are
so intense</text><text start="149.43" dur="4.071">your screen can&amp;#39;t display them, the pixels
cannot go red, green or blue enough.</text><text start="153.501" dur="1.958">And this is one of them.</text><text start="155.459" dur="2.721">There are massive libraries of pigments,</text><text start="158.18" dur="4.62">organic ones, inorganic ones, synthetic ones,
created ones, natural ones,</text><text start="162.8" dur="2.579">and they&amp;#39;ve been digging them up
since day dot.</text><text start="165.379" dur="2.61">&amp;#39;Mummy brown&amp;#39; was made out of ground-up mummies.</text><text start="167.989" dur="4.171">So there&amp;#39;s a huge database of pigments that
you can order.</text><text start="172.16" dur="1.29">And you can play with them.</text><text start="173.45" dur="2.35">I&amp;#39;ve made mixes of these pigments and binders,</text><text start="175.8" dur="4.439">created something, tweaked it, and gone back
and got these relationships right.</text><text start="180.24" dur="2.86">So it&amp;#39;s quite a complicated little potion,
actually.</text><text start="183.1" dur="2.8">In a few years&amp;#39; time,
technology will move on.</text><text start="185.909" dur="3.97">It&amp;#39;s already possible to buy expensive equipment
with a wider colour gamut,</text><text start="189.879" dur="2.431">and that might be able to display this pink.</text><text start="192.31" dur="4.63">But in the meantime, I can try and simulate
what being here is like.</text><text start="196.94" dur="4.329">In this shot, this one here, I&amp;#39;ve digitally
adjusted the saturation of this pink</text><text start="201.269" dur="2.111">so it&amp;#39;s not quite as intense.</text><text start="203.38" dur="1.92">Now if I turn it back up...</text><text start="206.6" dur="3.02">Imagine that change, but more so.</text><text start="209.62" dur="1.509">That&amp;#39;s how pink this pink is.</text><text start="211.129" dur="2.291">It is ridiculously pink.</text><text start="214.34" dur="1.98">Thank you to Stuart Semple and all the team
at his workshop:</text><text start="216.32" dur="4.62">pull down the description for more about them,
their pigments, and this pink.</text><text start="221.88" dur="1.24">This is gorgeous!</text><text start="223.129" dur="3.39">I cannot get over how luminous this is.</text><text start="226.519" dur="3.22">I started out, like, &amp;quot;well, this isn&amp;#39;t doing
anything, this is just powder&amp;quot;</text><text start="229.739" dur="1.89">and then it just goes!</text></transcript>
